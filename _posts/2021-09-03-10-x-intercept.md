Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #10**. I had to do a double-take on how many posts I've done so far. It's my tenth blog post which marks four months into my gap year.

What better way to celebrate than... to dab online!

But seriously, thank you to all those who have been reading my blog. Whether I had told about inklings of a gap year before the blog existed, you had just discovered this blog, you've seen my cheesy captions in my LinkedIn posts, or you've read every single blog post alongside my equally cheesy captions in my email newsletter - **thank you**!

### What I’ve seen

After returning from vacation, I've decided to try my hand in gardening! I received some herb seeds in the Indiana State Fair so I could grow my own garden. After a mishap that caused me to lose my thyme seeds, and anticipated patience, the seeds finally sprouted from their pod of soil!

*(Left) Cilantro and oregano seedlings sprouting out from the soil. The oregano seedling is very tiny, but it's there! The sage needed a bit more time and help poking out of the soil. (Right) The cilantro seedling was transplanted into its own pot. It's growing quickly over the past day or so with the south sunlight. Can't wait to season my food with homegrown food!*
