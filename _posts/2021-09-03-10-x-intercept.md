Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #10**. I had to do a double-take on how many posts I've done so far. It's my tenth blog post which marks four months into my gap year.

What better way to celebrate than... to dab online!

But seriously, thank you to all those who have been reading my blog. Whether I had told about inklings of a gap year before the blog existed, you had just discovered this blog, you've seen my cheesy captions in my LinkedIn posts, or you've read every single blog post alongside my equally cheesy captions [in my email newsletter](https://www.warunlock.com/subscribe/) - **thank you**!

### The gap year so far

Now four months into my gap year, I can say that it's been a great experience so far. Yes, the pandemic is still going on so I can't travel as extensively as I'd like to. That and the unusually oppressive summer weather kept me indoors for longer than I wanted to so far. It took a while before the news agreed on the term [the Great Resignation](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit), which I guess I'm a part of now.

It's been great to explore new opportunities, learn different topics in-depth, and to unplug from the chaos. Plus, I can say that I'm financially within my gap year budget so far!

Here are some highlights from the previous 9 blog posts:
1. [Hello World](https://www.warunlock.com/1-hello-world/) - Why did I take a gap year? And what kind of insurance did I pick up?
2. [A New Chapter](https://www.warunlock.com/2-a-new-chapter/) - Decompressing after quitting my job, and learning about decompression sickness.
3. [Rite of Spring](https://www.warunlock.com/3-rite-of-spring/) - Why exercising is good for you, and how to sustain an exercise routine. (Before NYC became hot and humid.)
4. [Calm Before the Storm](https://www.warunlock.com/4-calm-before-the-storm/) - I made ice cream to stave off the heatwave, and learned the chemistry behind ice cream making!
5. [Morning Mood](https://www.warunlock.com/5-morning-mood/) - I'm enjoying my time outside in NYC, while protecting my skin from UV rays and getting back to a routine.
6. [Heatwave](https://www.warunlock.com/6-heatwave/) - I visited Portland, ME and Boston, MA for vacation, and dived more into different aspects of culture.
7. [Punching Bag](https://www.warunlock.com/7-punching-bag/) - I talk about the process of exploration vs. practice, and how it applies to me during my gap year.
8. [Into the Unknown](https://www.warunlock.com/8-into-the-unknown/) - I visit Indianapolis, then talk about fluid mechanics because why not?
9. [Refresh Button](https://www.warunlock.com/9-refresh-button/) - I visit San Francisco, then talk about the physics of heat and why I complain about it insistently during the summer.

*So what's next for the rest of the year?* Well, since it's the gap year, it'll probably be just as scattered as the highlights have shown. Do look out for a blog post in December, where I'll flex my data analytics-muscles and post [some fancy statistics and graphs for the 2021 year](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject).

### What I’ve been up to

The past two weeks have been continuing to settle matters post-vacation, now that I will not do any extensive travel for the next couple of weeks (that I'm anticipating). I've done some apartment renovations to accommodate the need for more bookshelves to store books and boxes. (Exciting stuff, I know.) I've extended my hospital volunteer shifts to make up for missed hours. And during the hotter days, I've gotten back to my queue of miniatures to paint - featuring [little doggos having an adventure](https://steamforged.com/games/animal-adventures)!

Since early in the pandemic, I've been curious about the COVID-19 virus beyond news publications for non-medical peeps and COVID-19 case statistics (because both range from depressing to anger-inducing). It turned into quite a rabbit hole of re-learning biology and chemistry. *For context, I haven't taken a biology class since 9th grade in high school, and I begrudgingly took a general chemistry class in freshman year of college for my CS degree.*

I'm in-progress on taking [Organic Chemistry](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry). I knew about its notorious reputation from friends and family. for being hard as nails. I can say from my experience so far... **yes, it's hard as nails.** It's definitely not intuitive, but more of weird math and puzzle solving with hieroglyphics. However, it's amazing to learn on how organic chemistry affects our everyday lives. It's in cooking, lotions, plastics, our bodies' metabolism, sunscreen, and so much more.

Lastly, my [CKAD certification](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/) is expiring this year. I learned earlier last week that the exam focus points are changing at the end of this month. Sooooooooo I'm going to renew my certification by the end of September!

### What I’ve learned

Let's talk about **aspirin**! Aspirin is known for reducing fever or pain, as well as an [emergency medicine when someone is experiencing a heart attack](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/aspirin-for-heart-attack-chew-or-swallow). I don't really own any aspirin, and instead have ibuprofen in my closet for fevers and pain.

Aspirin is a brand name for the chemical *acetylsalicylic acid* which... is quite a mouthful.

Before aspirin, the willow tree bark was known for its curative properties, such as reducing pain and fevers. This property was isolated during the 19th century into salicylic acid. However, salicylic acid was known to cause gastrointestinal irritation as a major side effect. The Bayer company discovered that modifying the salicylic acid in a simple way would reduce the GI irritation side effect. [Thus, acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin, was invented and coined by the Bayer company in 1897.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1894700/)


### What I’ve seen

After returning from vacation, I've decided to try my hand in gardening! I received some herb seeds in the Indiana State Fair so I could grow my own garden. After a mishap that caused me to lose my thyme seeds, and anticipated patience, the seeds finally sprouted from their pod of soil!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog10/blog10-seedlings.jpeg" width="350"><img src="/images/blog10/blog10-cilantro.jpeg" width="350"></div>

*(Left) Cilantro and oregano seedlings sprouting out from the soil. The oregano seedling is very tiny, but it's there! The sage needed a bit more time and help poking out of the soil. (Right) The cilantro seedling was transplanted into its own pot. It's growing quickly over the past day or so with the south sunlight. Can't wait to season my food with homegrown food!*
