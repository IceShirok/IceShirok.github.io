### What I’ve seen

After returning from vacation, I've decided to try my hand in gardening! I received some herb seeds in the Indiana State Fair so I could grow my own garden. After a mishap that caused me to lose my thyme seeds, and anticipated patience, the seeds finally sprouted from their pod of soil!

*(Left) Cilantro and oregano seedlings sprouting out from the soil. The oregano seedling is very tiny, but it's there! The sage needed a bit more time and help poking out of the soil. (Right) The cilantro seedling was transplanted into its own pot. It's growing quickly over the past day or so with the south sunlight. Can't wait to season my food with homegrown food!*
