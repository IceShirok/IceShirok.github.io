Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #19** and I'm celebrating this blog's first ever blogiversary!

### What I’ve been up to

TBD

### What I’ve learned

[In the previous blog post](https://www.warunlock.com/18-firehose/), I've talked about the central dogma of molecular biology and why enzymes are so important for living. I also talked a little about the medical applications of such concepts, which include unintended side effects of prescription drugs.

Why are there unintentional side effects in prescription drugs? Why do allergens cause allergies? Why are certain foods safe for humans but toxic for our pets? They all have to do with the communication breakdown in our bodies, resulting in homeostasis going awry as well.

#### Communication is key - in cells too

Did you know that cells can communicate? In fact, it is part of the essential aspects of living beings - living beings are able to take sensory input of the outside world, and react accordingly.

Cells have receptors that bind to a specific ligand with a very specific shape. A bound receptor triggers one of three responses: 1) amplification of the signal, 2) gene expression, or 3) terminating a signal.

Bacteria can form biofilms to increase their collective survival by surrounding themselves in a protective slime layer and sharing resources. They are able to coordinate the collective action through quorum sensing (for the tech-saavy, not unlike peer-to-peer networking).

In contrast, a living organism is like a massive ecosystem of specialized systems working together (for the tech-saavy, something like a complex, distributed fleet of services). Some problems, such as a small scrape on the skin, can be handled locally. Other problems, such as hunger or a developing cold, requires coordination of multiple organ systems. These organ systems can be rapidly signalled through the nervous system, or slowly messaged through the endocrine and cardiovascular systems.

#### Communication gone awry

While the human body, and really any living being, is a marvel on its complexity.

#### Example - the *Clostridium* genus

### What I’ve seen

After morning standup, I go to the kitchen to refill my cup of tea. My home boss will sometimes seize the opportunity to get into his chair and tell me to stop talking to my computer.

Also here are some random articles I've come across. I typically don't like posting a mass of random articles, but I found these enjoyable.
* [What does niceness vs. kindness mean?](https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/42-are-you-nice-or-kind) and how it applies to our lives.
* [Uncleftish Beholding](https://msburkeenglish.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/uncleftish-beholding-aka-atomic-theory.pdf), or a short essay on explaining atomic theory without using any borrowed Germanic words.

### A chapter closed
