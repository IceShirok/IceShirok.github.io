Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #19** and I'm celebrating this blog's first ever blogiversary!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog19/blog19-colin-caterpillar.jpg" width="350"></div>

While the gap year has ended early, the blog is still very much live. You can read [the blog post X-Intercept](https://www.warunlock.com/10-xintercept/) to get the highlights of the first ten blog posts. You can also read about some fascinating facts about aspirin and see some progress pictures of my herb garden. (Spoilers, the herb garden never came to fruition.)

Here are the other highlights of the previous blog posts:
* [Deep Lore - CKAD Exam Prep](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/) - A guide on how I prepared for the CKAD, a certification test for Kubernetes. Very technical! (Spoilers, I passed the exam!)
* [In-flight](https://www.warunlock.com/11-inflight/) - I've catalogued many larger tasks I've been doing in NYC, then debuted a three-part series on electricity.
* [Home Is Where the Heart Is](https://www.warunlock.com/12-home/) - I introduce my new housemate and boss cat, Monty! I also relate electricity with Ohm's Law, and how electrical energy acts as an intermediary energy source. (Bonus - the title also references [a t-shirt that I've meaning to get](https://shop.critrole.com/products/caleb-home-is-where-the-heart-is-t-shirt)!)
* [Spoopy Times](https://www.warunlock.com/13-spoopy-times/) - It's Halloween! I wrap up the electricity deep dive with circuits, while I excuse myself with posting more adorable cat pics.
* [Deep Lore - Hospital Volunteering](https://www.warunlock.com/14-extra-volunteering/) - This is another deep dive blog reflecting on my ~9 months volunteering in a hospital. It's been a great experience to learn about healthcare, as well as help the patients and staff.
* [Looking Back](https://www.warunlock.com/15-looking-back/) - The last blog post of 2021! This bigger-than-usual blog post reflects on all the planned projects I've completed or dropped, as well as some unplanned projects I've done as a result of the gap year. I also get into my data analytic side and post a bunch of charts around my budgeting and study hours.
* [Peppermint Mocha](https://www.warunlock.com/16-peppermint-mocha/) - The first blog post of 2022! The COVID-19 Omicron variant has thrown a wrench in my plans, but I've been able to occupy myself with other tasks. I also start another three-part series around what we eat and why we eat!
* [Eye of the Tiger](https://www.warunlock.com/17-eye-of-the-tiger/) - I celebrate Chinese New Year my making some dumplings. I then talk about the concept of metabolism and how it works in a human and cell levels.
* [Firehose](https://www.warunlock.com/18-firehose/) - I celebrate March with the completion of Dark Souls and one month into a new job! I then talk about the central dogma of molecular biology, and how biotechnology uses that knowledge to keep people healthy.

### What I’ve been up to

*Well, this is awkward.* Since I'm now working a full-time software engineering job, my monthly happenings will be more boring than usual. Since, you know, I can't just go to a museum on a random Thursday afternoon. (I mean, I could, but I try to be a responsible person.) But that's okay too!

With COVID-19 cases being relatively low and stable in NYC, I (safely) met up with various coworkers and friends this month. I was too eager to take any pictures for prosperity (and also for privacy reasons). Also, not being acclimated to traveling and socializing with colleagues in-person has resulted in my introverted soul resting long after each social event. That meant more takeout and breaks as I continue adjusting to work life and doing my adulting tasks.

In the meanwhile, I've been going through a small list of video games - [one that hits a sweet spot of nostalgia](https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/), [a clever point-and-click adventure game that hits sociopolitical topics with tongue-and-cheek](https://discoelysium.com/), and [another replay of a charming waterfowl puzzler](https://goose.game/). I've also started catching up on the Stormlight Chronicles novel series as a bedtime reading. Nothing like cuddling with the kitty while immersing myself into a unique fantasy universe.

### What I’ve learned

[In the previous blog post](https://www.warunlock.com/18-firehose/), I've talked about the central dogma of molecular biology and why enzymes are so important for living. I also talked a little about the medical applications of such concepts, which include unintended side effects of prescription drugs.

While the human body, and really any living being, is a marvel on its complexity. While the body does a pretty good job fixing itself and adapting to various stimuli, it's not perfect. *Why are there sometimes unintentional side effects in prescription drugs? Why do allergens cause allergies in some people but not others?* They all have to do with the communication breakdown in our bodies, resulting in homeostasis going awry as well. Let's see some examples of how various scenarios involving receptors can cause disease.

P.S. I've done some research on why certain human foods are toxic to pets. Turns out that, [for dogs and chocolate, this is a metabolism issue](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/chocolate-poisoning-in-dogs)! Dogs don't have the enzymes to breakdown caffeine and theobromine as quickly as humans, so they're at greater risk of a lethal buildup.

#### Communication is key - in cells too

Did you know that cells can communicate? In fact, it is part of [the essential aspects of living beings](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_Introductory_Biology_(CK-12)/01%3A_Introduction_to_Biology/1.04%3A_Characteristics_of_Life) - living beings are able to take sensory input of the outside world, perform certain (internal) actions involving complex chemical processes, and react accordingly.

This is the same in tech. For example, clicking a button on a webpage triggers a cascade of actions. Externally, the webpage is redirected to a new page with a successful response. Internally, many other things are happening. Logging, sending metrics, saving data in a database or a cookie, triggering events, sending events to external systems, etc. (In fact, the [idea of cognitive psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive.html) derives from the advent of computers, with the idea that the mind has an internal state that changes with input, but we're diverging from the topic at hand.)

Cells have receptors that bind to a specific ligand with [a very specific shape in a "lock-and-key" fashion](https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/lock-and-key-model). A bound receptor triggers one of three signaling pathways or cascades: 1) amplification of the signal, 2) gene expression, or 3) terminating a signal. In reality, these [signaling cascades can get very, very complicated](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cell-communication-and-cell-cycle/changes-in-signal-transduction-pathways/a/intracellular-signal-transduction) with the assortment of ligands, enzymes, and receptors that can be involved.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog19/blog19-signaling-cascade.JPG" width="350"></div>

[Bacteria can form biofilms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732559/) to increase their collective survival by surrounding themselves in a protective slime layer and sharing resources. They are able to coordinate the collective action through [quorum sensing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543102/) (for the tech-saavy, not unlike [peer-to-peer networking](https://www.lifewire.com/p2p-networking-and-software-818019)).

In contrast, a living organism is like a massive ecosystem of specialized systems working together (for the tech-saavy, something like a complex, distributed fleet of services).
* Some problems, such as a small cut on the skin, can be handled locally (inflammation, recruiting white blood cells to handle infection, clotting, etc).
* Other problems require coordination of multiple organ systems. These organ systems can be [rapidly signalled through the nervous system, or slowly messaged through the endocrine system](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-human-body-systems/hs-the-nervous-and-endocrine-systems/a/hs-the-nervous-and-endocrine-systems-review). For example, the [fight-or-flight response](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Sympathetic_Nervous_System) is a good example of how multiple organ systems are coordinated to get a person's body ready to respond to a threat - more oxygen (respiratory), more energy to the muscles (muscular), enlarged pupils (sensory), and suppressed hunger (digestive).

#### Communication gone awry - pathogens

**Pathogens can be identified by "antigens"**, which the immune system can "remember" to defend against in a future infection with a faster response. Immune cells build up receptors that adapt specifically to the antigen. Pathogens (which can be bacterial or viral) can [rapidly change their antigens so that they can no longer be bound to the receptor](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm). The immune system considers this pathogen a "new" invader and has to spend time building up a new response. This gives the pathogen more time to infect and wreck havoc.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog19/blog19-antigenic-drift.JPG" width="350"></div>

[**Cholera** is known to rapidly kill people due to rapid dehydration.](https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/illness.html) The bacteria that survives the passage through the acidic stomach hangs out and multiplies in the intestines. The bacteria produces a toxin that causes an overdrive of a certain signaling pathway, which causes excessive water and electrolytes to leak out of the intestines and out of the body.

The pathogens within the [*Clostridium* genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium) include bacteria responsible for causing botulism and tetanus, gas gangrene, and (formerly, from a taxonomy perspective) *C. difficile* infection (CDI). They also primarily cause disease by 1) colonizing within the human body, and 2) producing toxins based on a critical mass of bacteria. The pathogens that cause botulism and tetanus produce toxins that "block" the signals for muscle cells and neurons to communicate with each other, which results in paralysis and death. They can kill a person before treatment can be delivered on time, since treatments of such diseases require both an antibiotic to kill the bacterial population, AND an antitoxin to get rid of the toxin buildup.

#### Communication gone awry - confusion of the self

**Type 2 diabetes** is caused by "insulin resistance", or that body cells don't respond to the signal of insulin in the bloodstream. Because the body cells' receptors don't respond to insulin as well, they don't know to start taking glucose from the bloodstream, and thus blood sugar can remain at a dangerously high level. However, [the exact mechanism why insulin resistance occurs is currently insanely complex](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941218/).

**Allergies** occur because [the body's immune system is overreacting to a normally-harmless allergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_hypersensitivity). The immune system has to be careful to balance between:
1) responding to a legitimate threat (or become damaged by the threat)
2) ignoring a non-threatening object (or cause an allergic reaction)
3) not attacking body cells (or cause an autoimmune disorder)
4) ...unless they're cancerous cells (which involves some backdoor mechnisms, but that's even more complicated than what I'll cover).

**Type 1 diabetes** is an example of an autoimmune disorder. Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which can be controlled through diet and exercise (depends on the situation), Type 1 diabetes is caused by the person's antibodies attacking the pancreas. [The pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin at all](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/what-is-type-1-diabetes.html), resulting in the person needing to inject insulin regularly so the body cells knows to take up blood sugar.

#### Communication gone awry - medicine

**Antibiotics target bacteria without largely affecting humans**. Why's that? It turns out, bacteria have different structures from human cells. They are so different that, in most cases, antibiotics can target bacteria without affecting human cells. This is also why [antibiotics don't work on viruses](https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/q-a.html) - viruses are structured very differently from living cells, while also adapting extremely quickly to immune responses.

**Prescription drugs** are synthesized to target certain receptors within the human body. However, we don't fully understand all the receptors and resultant mechanisms in the human body. Also, each human have different variations of such receptors. This can result in [a prescription drug potential causing side effects that vary from person to person](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs/finding-and-learning-about-side-effects-adverse-reactions). These interactions can get more complicated when taking multiple medications or pre-existing conditions - so always talk to your doctor!

### What I’ve seen

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog19/blog19-workspace.jpg" width="350"></div>

After morning standup, I go to the kitchen to refill my cup of tea. My home boss will sometimes seize the opportunity to get into his chair and tell me to stop talking to my computer.

Also here are some random articles I've come across this month. I typically don't like posting a mass of random articles, but I found these interesting to read.
* [What does niceness vs. kindness mean?](https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/42-are-you-nice-or-kind) ft. some New York City culture speculation.
* [Uncleftish Beholding](https://msburkeenglish.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/uncleftish-beholding-aka-atomic-theory.pdf), or a short essay on explaining atomic theory without using any borrowed Germanic words.
* [RaDonda Vaught trial](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/03/25/1088902487/former-nurse-found-guilty-in-accidental-injection-death-of-75-year-old-patient) and the potential consequences of the precedent.
