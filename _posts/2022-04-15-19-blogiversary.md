Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #19** and I'm celebrating this blog's first ever blogiversary!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog19/blog19-colin-caterpillar.jpg" width="350"></div>

While the gap year has ended early, the blog is still very much live. You can read [the blog post X-Intercept](https://www.warunlock.com/10-xintercept/) to get the highlights of the first ten blog posts. You can also read about some fascinating facts about aspirin and see some progress pictures of my herb garden. (Spoilers, the herb garden never came to fruition.)

Here are the other highlights of the previous blog posts:
* [Deep Lore - CKAD Exam Prep](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/) - A guide on how I prepared for the CKAD, a certification test for Kubernetes. Very technical! (Spoilers, I passed the exam!)
* [In-flight](https://www.warunlock.com/11-inflight/) - I've catalogued many larger tasks I've been doing in NYC, then debuted a three-part series on electricity.
* [Home Is Where the Heart Is](https://www.warunlock.com/12-home/) - I introduce my new housemate and boss cat, Monty! I also relate electricity with Ohm's Law, and how electrical energy acts as an intermediary energy source. (Bonus - the title also references [a t-shirt that I've meaning to get](https://shop.critrole.com/products/caleb-home-is-where-the-heart-is-t-shirt)!)
* [Spoopy Times](https://www.warunlock.com/13-spoopy-times/) - It's Halloween! I wrap up the electricity deep dive with circuits, while I excuse myself with posting more adorable cat pics.
* [Deep Lore - Hospital Volunteering](https://www.warunlock.com/14-extra-volunteering/) - This is another deep dive blog reflecting on my ~9 months volunteering in a hospital. It's been a great experience to learn about healthcare, as well as help the patients and staff.
* [Looking Back](https://www.warunlock.com/15-looking-back/) - The last blog post of 2021! This bigger-than-usual blog post reflects on all the planned projects I've completed or dropped, as well as some unplanned projects I've done as a result of the gap year. I also get into my data analytic side and post a bunch of charts around my budgeting and study hours.
* [Peppermint Mocha](https://www.warunlock.com/16-peppermint-mocha/) - The first blog post of 2022! The COVID-19 Omicron variant has thrown a wrench in my plans, but I've been able to occupy myself with other tasks. I also start another three-part series around what we eat and why we eat!
* [Eye of the Tiger](https://www.warunlock.com/17-eye-of-the-tiger/) - I celebrate Chinese New Year my making some dumplings. I then talk about the concept of metabolism and how it works in a human and cell levels.
* [Firehose](https://www.warunlock.com/18-firehose/) - I celebrate March with the completion of Dark Souls and one month into a new job! I then talk about the central dogma of molecular biology, and how biotechnology uses that knowledge to keep people healthy.

### What I’ve been up to

*Well, this is awkward.* Since I'm now working a full-time software engineering job, my monthly happenings will be more boring than usual. Since, you know, I can't just go to a museum on a random Thursday afternoon. (I mean, I could, but I try to be a responsible citizen.) But that's okay too!

With COVID-19 cases being relatively low and stable in NYC, I (safely) met up with various coworkers and friends this month. I was too eager to take any pictures for prosperity (and also for privacy reasons). Also, not being acclimated to traveling and socializing with colleagues in-person has resulted in my introverted soul resting long after each social event. That meant more takeout and breaks as I continue adjusting to work life and doing my adulting tasks.

In the meanwhile, I've been going through a small list of video games - [one that hits a sweet spot of nostalgia](https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/), [a clever point-and-click adventure game that hits sociopolitical topics with tongue-and-cheek](https://discoelysium.com/), and [another replay of a charming waterfowl puzzler](https://goose.game/). I've also started catching up on the Stormlight Chronicles novel series as a bedtime reading. Nothing like cuddling with the kitty while immersing myself into a unique fantasy universe.

### What I’ve learned

[In the previous blog post](https://www.warunlock.com/18-firehose/), I've talked about the central dogma of molecular biology and why enzymes are so important for living. I also talked a little about the medical applications of such concepts, which include unintended side effects of prescription drugs.

Why are there unintentional side effects in prescription drugs? Why do allergens cause allergies? Why are certain foods safe for humans but toxic for our pets? They all have to do with the communication breakdown in our bodies, resulting in homeostasis going awry as well.

#### Communication is key - in cells too

Did you know that cells can communicate? In fact, it is part of the essential aspects of living beings - living beings are able to take sensory input of the outside world, and react accordingly.

Cells have receptors that bind to a specific ligand with a very specific shape. A bound receptor triggers one of three responses: 1) amplification of the signal, 2) gene expression, or 3) terminating a signal.

Bacteria can form biofilms to increase their collective survival by surrounding themselves in a protective slime layer and sharing resources. They are able to coordinate the collective action through quorum sensing (for the tech-saavy, not unlike peer-to-peer networking).

In contrast, a living organism is like a massive ecosystem of specialized systems working together (for the tech-saavy, something like a complex, distributed fleet of services). Some problems, such as a small scrape on the skin, can be handled locally. Other problems, such as hunger or a developing cold, requires coordination of multiple organ systems. These organ systems can be rapidly signalled through the nervous system, or slowly messaged through the endocrine and cardiovascular systems.

#### Communication gone awry

While the human body, and really any living being, is a marvel on its complexity.

#### Example - the *Clostridium* genus

### What I’ve seen

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog19/blog19-workspace.jpg" width="350"></div>

After morning standup, I go to the kitchen to refill my cup of tea. My home boss will sometimes seize the opportunity to get into his chair and tell me to stop talking to my computer.

Also here are some random articles I've come across. I typically don't like posting a mass of random articles, but I found these enjoyable.
* [What does niceness vs. kindness mean?](https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/42-are-you-nice-or-kind) and how it applies to our lives.
* [Uncleftish Beholding](https://msburkeenglish.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/uncleftish-beholding-aka-atomic-theory.pdf), or a short essay on explaining atomic theory without using any borrowed Germanic words.

### A chapter closed
