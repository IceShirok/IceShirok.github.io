After morning standup, I go to the kitchen to refill my cup of tea. My home boss will sometimes seize the opportunity to get into his chair and tell me to stop talking to my computer.

Also here are some random articles I've come across. I typically don't like posting a mass of random articles, but I found these enjoyable.
* [What does niceness vs. kindness mean?](https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/42-are-you-nice-or-kind) and how it applies to our lives.
* [Uncleftish Beholding](https://msburkeenglish.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/uncleftish-beholding-aka-atomic-theory.pdf), or a short essay on explaining atomic theory without using any borrowed Germanic words.

### A chapter closed
