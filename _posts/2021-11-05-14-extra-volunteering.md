title: Deep Lore - Hospital Volunteering
---

Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock - Deep Lore Edition**! Since I’ve mentioned about my hospital volunteering before, I’ll talk more about **my experience as a hospital volunteer so far.**

*Why?* The past couple of weeks have been a slew of logistics, phone calls, and text messages on my side as I prepare for the Thanksgiving holiday. I didn’t have enough material to write a normal blog post that:
1. Was interesting for the reader
2. Was interesting for me to write, because honestly there are a thousand generic time management articles in the Internet
3. Didn’t just involve a million pictures of Monty, even though I'd be happy to do that too

### Background

I started volunteering in the hospital in mid-March of 2021. At that time, the pandemic was tapering down after a rough surge during the winter months. I wanted to learn more about what exactly went on in a hospital. We hear about the [ICU department within hospitals across the US being overwhelmed](https://www.osfhealthcare.org/blog/what-is-the-icu-and-why-do-covid-19-patients-end-up-there/). I did a few one-time volunteering shifts at other organizations, but I sought for something more consistent and more aligned with my interests. Also, yes, I can be a little sadochistic with what exactly "aligned with my interests" if I chose a hospital. After chatting with the volunteer coordinator, I was assigned to [a med-surg unit](https://www.hosthealthcare.com/blog/what-is-med-surg-nursing/) as a good way to help out both patients and staff.

My first shift was honestly a bit overwhelming to take in. Without getting too personal, I haven’t set foot in a hospital in around 15 years. I was nervous and utterly inexperienced with what was going on around me. (Like, [what the heck is “pulse-ox”](https://www.healthline.com/health/normal-blood-oxygen-level)? Where are the gloves? Who do I talk to for XYZ?) And to top it off, half of the patient rooms on my assigned floor were COVID-19 isolation rooms. Welp. (I wasn't allowed to go near the rooms, but it was still a jumpscare for me.)

Fortunately, the volunteer coordinator reassured me that it would take a few shifts to acclimate to the hospital environment. I also had to readjust my thinking that:
* I was in the same position in my first tech job, where I knew none of the acronyms or unspoken processes worked. It took time to passively absorb the information and actively do my tasks.
* I was there to help patients in any way I could, with also ensured I wasn't doing something I shouldn't be doing, like medical procedures.

It did take a few shifts to get adjusted, and a couple more shifts to feel confident with my abilities and knowledge. I round with patients, which means going around and asking if patients need anything (water, extra blankets, speaking with a healthcare professional). With help from a few nurse aides, I helped with restocking the [phlebotomy](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-phlebotomy) carts, which the nurses and nurse aides use to draw blood. I also restocked [isolation carts for rooms with particularly infectious diseases](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000446.htm). I ferry blood samples down [to the laboratory](https://laboratorycareer.com/laboratory/) so the samples are tested before they clot. There are many more small tasks that I help out but can’t list them all.

I’ve also done a lot of passive observations. I learned how the nurses and nurse aides worked on the floor. The unit clerk keeps the unit working on the administrative side. I see medical teams chatting with patients and each other. I watched people from the kitchen serve meals, transporters ferrying patients for procedures, environmental services keeping the floor clean, security guards occasionally patrolling, physical therapists helping patients walk, patient services getting feedback from patients… Many people make the unit buzz!

Not to mention all of the beeping around the place. The call bell occasionally rings within the entire unit, waiting to be answered. The telemetry dashboard beeps whenever a threshold is met. IVs that need refilling start beeping obnoxiously.

And yes, I’m throwing out a ton of words that took me months to get straight.

### What I’ve learned

In all these months of volunteering, I’ve learned a lot from the experience. Of course, being me, I will definitely draw these experiences to my healthcare noob life.

*There is a LOT of communication.* Within the floor, there are tasks that can impact a patient’s well-being or health. When a task needs to be done, one would do the task and promptly follow up. Time is a precious treasure on the floor, and it would be detrimental to miss a task or to need to repeat one because a person didn’t follow up.

Similarly, if a patient asks for something, I would need to come back with the request completed, or to explain to them why I can’t fulfill the request (nurse is busy, nurse doesn’t allow it, waiting for something else).

Another thing that I didn’t think I’d do was communicate to patients and their family in Chinese. For those who didn’t speak English well enough, I often became an intermediate between them and the nursing staff. I’m not allowed to be an interpreter for medical or logistical information, but I could help relay concerns or fulfill requests more quickly.

*It takes time to acclimate to the environment, and to be comfortable asking questions.* As you can imagine, a hospital is busy as heck. At certain times, staff gets tense and may not be as receptive to help a volunteer. It took some time to get a feel of the ebb and flow of the floor, and to not be afraid of asking questions if it meant working more independently next time. I appreciated the staff who pulled me in to help on various tasks.

*Volunteering can get boring, or it can get hectic.* In normal and calm times, yes, I get bored on my shift. Patients don’t need anything or are asleep, carts are restocked, and staff don’t have anything they need assistance with. Water refills are also not the most exciting things to do.

However, there are times where I’m on my feet for the majority of my shift because the floor is just hectic for reasons (short of staff, difficult patients, too much to do). Sometimes I get discouraged because of an upset patient. However, another patient gave me advice to “not take it personally” because patients may act out of the situation, rather than the person.

*I have SO much appreciation for the nurses and staff.* Whether through observation or chatting with the staff, I have a great appreciation for what they do as a full-time job. I only spent 4 to 6 hours per shift, while nurses stayed for a full 12 hours taking care of multiple patients.

*Yes, there is a nurse shortage.* The nurses are stressed out with COVID-19 on top of more patients to manage, churn, unfair compensation, and toxic environments. I think we all acknowledge that all industries are suffering the churn rate and lack of experienced workers, but it doesn’t make our lives easier. Heck, I’ve helped some new nurses in the past few weeks since it would free up some time for the more seasoned nurses.

*There’s HIPAA, so no specific stories from me.* I’ve heard and seen many events on the floor that I don’t think I’m allowed to talk about on the Internet. There was gross stuff. There were laughs and tears. I’ve enjoyed eating lunch with staff who had the time for a break. I left shifts feeling great, while other times I felt terrible.
