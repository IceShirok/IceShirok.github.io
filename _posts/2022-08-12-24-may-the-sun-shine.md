Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #24**! I’ve continued to enjoy the summer months enjoying the sights and filling my stomach with good eats, while keeping myself hydrated and sunburn-free. (So far, so good!) I've also met a new friend along my journey (but don't tell my cat).

# What I’ve been up to

Like last month’s blog post, I’ve continued to explore various parts of New York City (and even wandered about the New Jersey area) during my time off. This time, I’ve embraced the sun and heat, especially after a heatwave kept me mostly indoors for an entire week.

# What I’ve seen

I’ve also come across a little farm for my Airbnb! I was originally planning to stay in a hotel, but some late-night browsing brought this gem to my attention. I stayed in a cozy red cabin with a bed on a loft, a kitchen with fresh farm eggs, and a compostable toilet. Every morning, I would walk to the green pastures to meet the chickens and goats, then be greeted by curious pigs. And on nights that didn’t rain, I would lay in a hammock and take in the sounds of frogs croaking and insects chirping.

…but I’ve accidentally deleted all of those photos, not knowing they hadn’t been backed up on my cloud storage. ☹️ I did have a stroke of luck and had some lesser quality photos saved in my smartphone’s trash.

I usually try to appreciate the sights and sounds to memory, and take pictures should my memory fail to remember the visuals. Having lost most of the photos bummed me out for some time, but that only meant that I needed to book that Airbnb again in the near-future!
