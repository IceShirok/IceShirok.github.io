Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #24**! I’ve continued to enjoy the summer months enjoying the sights and filling my stomach with good eats, while keeping myself hydrated and sunburn-free. (So far, so good!) I've also met a new friend along my journey (but don't tell my cat).

# What I’ve been up to

Like last month’s blog post, I’ve continued to explore various parts of New York City (and even wandered about the New Jersey area) during my time off. This time, I’ve embraced the sun and heat, especially after a heatwave kept me mostly indoors for an entire week.

# What I’ve learned

Let’s talk about the **kidneys**! People have heard about coronary heart disease and diabetes among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the U.S, but did you know [about 1 in 7 Americans may have chronic kidney disease](https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/basics.html)? Even worse, high blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes also cause 75% of kidney failure! But what exactly do our kidneys do in our bodies, and why is chronic kidney disease (CKD) so detrimental to our health? Let me take you on a rabbit hole that I’ve been diving into to learn more!

## Chemistry and physics in action

The kidney is a bean-shaped organ; a typical human will have a pair of kidneys located towards the back of the body and towards the bottom of your ribcage. They are considered the main organ in [the urinary system](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/anatomy-of-the-urinary-system). (Sitting on top of them are the party hat-shaped [adrenal glands](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/adrenal-gland) which perform primarily endocrine functions.)

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog24/blog24-cute_kidneys.png" width="350"></div>

Their main job within your body is to [filter out wastes and maintain a chemical balance within your bloodstream](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/health-threats-from-high-blood-pressure/how-high-blood-pressure-can-lead-to-kidney-damage-or-failure). This chemical balance allows your body’s cells and [proteins to work in an optimal environment](https://www.warunlock.com/18-firehose/). Such chemical balance includes keeping your [blood’s pH to a 7.4](https://www.webmd.com/lung/what-to-know-about-acid-base-balance), making sure your blood has the [right proportions of electrolytes and water](https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/22-1-osmoregulation-and-osmotic-balance/), and managing your blood pressure (to some extent).

How does this [filtration system work](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/kidney-blood-vessels)?

There’s [a renal artery](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/kidneys-how-they-work) that brings in oxygen-rich blood into the kidneys. The renal artery splits off in a tree branch-like fashion until they reach a microscopic level and cluster into a cup-like device called a [glomerulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus_(kidney)). The blood flow within these blood vessels runs in a much higher speed which allows water, electrolytes, urea, and other substances to pass through the glomerulus. Substances pass through depending on [osmotic concentrations and pressure](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ap2/chapter/physiology-of-urine-formation/) within and without the glomerulus. (Physics and chemistry in action!) The filtered blood continues to flow to provide oxygen to the kidney, then the deoxygenated blood goes through the renal vein to be re-oxygenated by the lungs.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog24/blog24-nephron.png" width="350"></div>

Stuff that gets shunted out of the blood vessel is known as filtrate, and goes through another round of filtration and reabsorption through the kidney’s functional unit - [the nephron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron). As the filtrate goes through the nephron, more waste products are excreted as filtrate, and useful resources are reabsorbed back into the blood vessels surrounding the nephron. Filtrate eventually leaves the nephron into a collecting duct, where it is now officially called urine. Urine flows out of the collecting ducts, out of the kidneys through the renal hilum, and down to the bladder.

## Complement to other systems

The kidneys are one of several organs that filter blood in the cardiovascular system, but they also work with other organs to maintain such chemical balance of the cardiovascular system. For example:

- [The liver](https://columbiasurgery.org/liver/liver-and-its-functions) filters out toxic waste products from the bloodstream, among over 500 other functions. (Really!)
- The digestive system is a primarily entry-only system to the bloodstream. Its goal is to breakdown food and drink to be [absorbed as nutrients for the body](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4956471/). Substances don’t exit from the bloodstream to the intestines. (That’s bad.)
- The respiratory system complements the urinary system in terms of [pH balance with oxygen and carbon dioxide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507807/). There is even a certain balance of carbon dioxide you need in your body, and can explain why [you may breathe in a paper bag if you hyperventilate](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/hyperventilation)!

## Chronic kidney disease

Now that you’ve learn how the kidneys are structured (anatomy) and what they do (physiology), let’s learn why CKD is such a hgue problem. These tiny blood vessels, responsible for filtering out waste products and reabsorbing nutrients, [are very sensitive.](https://vascularcures.org/vascular_diseases/kidney-failure-and-vascular-disease/) Damage to the kidneys results in the bloodstream not being able to filter out excess resources or wastes properly.

- They can get damaged when filtering an extreme amount of substances - which can include a large amount of substances, or a low amount of water (from dehydration). Diabetes is a disease that introduces the risk of high blood sugar (glucose), which can [damage the blood vessels](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/diabetes-kidney-disease.html) (among the kidneys as well as the eyes) from the excess sugar. Those with kidney (or liver) disease also require a smaller dosage of medication, since they cannot filter medications from their bloodstream as efficiently.
- [High blood pressure can also damage blood vessels.](https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/High-Blood-Pressure-and-CKD) Blood vessels are normally elastic, but excess stretching from the pressure and plaque buildup can wear down blood vessels over time. The filtration damage can also lead to water retention (not being able to excrete water or sodium), further raising blood pressure in a vicious cycle.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog24/blog24-kidney_disease.png" width="350"></div>

Those with chronic kidney disease may need to perform [hemodialysis](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/kidney-failure/hemodialysis) every few days. This process involves the use of a dialysis machine to filter a person’s blood. A [kidney transplant](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidney-transplant) is other potential solution, but comes with the risks of organ transplant and a long waitlist. In recent years, [an artificial kidney](https://www.kidneyx.org/) is being developed as an alternative to hemodialysis and kidney transplantation.

## Conclusion

Learning about kidneys, what they do, and why they’re such a big deal have been fascinating to learn and felt underrated in comparison to other organs in the body. They not only [serve a vital function in our bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlkTx6DiJMQ), but can affect and be affected by other organ systems of the body.

# What I’ve seen

I’ve also come across a little farm for my Airbnb! I was originally planning to stay in a hotel, but some late-night browsing brought this gem to my attention. I stayed in a cozy red cabin with a bed on a loft, a kitchen with fresh farm eggs, and a compostable toilet. Every morning, I would walk to the green pastures to meet the chickens and goats, then be greeted by curious pigs. And on nights that didn’t rain, I would lay in a hammock and take in the sounds of frogs croaking and insects chirping.

…but I’ve accidentally deleted all of those photos, not knowing they hadn’t been backed up on my cloud storage. ☹️ I did have a stroke of luck and had some lesser quality photos saved in my smartphone’s trash.

I usually try to appreciate the sights and sounds to memory, and take pictures should my memory fail to remember the visuals. Having lost most of the photos bummed me out for some time, but that only meant that I needed to book that Airbnb again in the near-future!
