Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #17**! The past few weeks have been a busy time for me. Nothing like some delicious food and some video games to break up the monotomy! (Also my wit levels are low at the time of writing...)

### What I’ve been up to
**It’s Chinese New Year!** The Year of the Tiger is here. The winter storm at the end of January had given me ample time to make some homemade dumplings. I made a traditional ground pork and cabbage dumpling, as well as a vegetarian mushroom and fennel variety. My extended family from across the globe also got together virtually via WeChat to wish a safe and happy new year. As a bonus, I’ve received some funky tiger art for my Steam account.

I’ve also been wrapping up [a Microbiology course](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/nester-s-microbiology-human-perspective-anderson-salm/M9781260735505.html) that I’ve been taking since November. I've learned a lot about how microbes work like tiny machines, and how they affect our human lives in both a positive and negative way. I’ve also spent an inordinate time studying for the final. I’ve been transcribing my study notes into Google Docs so I can get a refresher on the details and get the list of major topics to synthesize ideas around. Unfortunately, I’ve got over 120 pages of notes to review for my final exam this week. Wish me luck.

To keep myself sane in between study sessions, I’ve finished quite a few items from my "Things to Play/Watch" list - [Fringe on HBO Max](https://play.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYGhpSwCFYsISvQEAAAAH), [Pathfinder: Kingmaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/), and [Pokemon Legends: Arceus](https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/). It didn’t help that I did get a small hit of the post-show blues to demotivate me from studying anyways.

Of course, it’s been a lot of cooking and takeout - whether it be eating out with friends, cooking in the midst of a winter storm, or just munching on a bodega sandwich. I don’t remember who exactly said that the best way to improve your cooking is to eat out at restaurants, but it’s definitely been true. (And I definitely don’t say that to excuse myself from more takeout.) For example, omurice (Japanese omelette over rice) has been the latest inspiration!

### What I’ve learned

In the last blog post, I’ve written the first part of a three-part series on why we eat food - for fuel! For example, dumplings (see below) is made up of carbohydrates (flour wrappers), protein (ground pork), fats (oil), fiber (cabbage), vitamins, and minerals. Not to mention other herbs and spices that provide a variety of flavors and healthly goodness.

Well, that makes sense, but what actually happens to the food that we eat that provides energy? In short, the answer is metabolism.

Note that this topic can get super dense super quickly. I had at least three separate courses talk about metabolism in slightly different angles. It also took that long before I really appreciated the complexity of the process!
What is metabolism?
Depends on who you ask. Let’s talk about the biological science definition. “Metabolism” is considered the sum of all biochemical reactions in our body. What does that mean?

My organic chemistry professor described the basis of chemistry as relationships between molecules - the formation and breaking between atoms and molecules to form a new set of chemicals. Breaking bonds release energy, while forming bonds require energy. Organic chemistry is a bit more complex because it uses a very small number of distinct atoms arranged in very complex forms.

Now what about the health association with weight loss? Well, that’s an answer that even healthcare professionals don’t have a definite answer on.

Did you know that 60-70% of the calories that you should be eating contributes to keeping your body working? Only 15% of calories contribute to physical activity. Also, for every decade of your life, your metabolism slows by 1-2% every year - so make sure to adjust your diet accordingly!
What is respiration?
Again, depends on who you ask.

We’ll focus on the cell, the basic unit of life. Cells that perform cellular respiration typically take in glucose and oxygen. Through respiration, they produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Sounds familiar? We also eat carbs and breathe in oxygen, and we produce carbon dioxide and energy as a result!

There are three main steps in cellular respiration: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the Electron Transport Chain.

Glycolysis is where glucose (glyco-) is broken down (-lysis) into two identical molecules called pyruvate. The glucose being broken down releases energy in the process (called catabolism). This energy is harnessed through electrons, which are picked up by electron carriers.

The pyruvate is then recycled through the Krebs cycle, where carbon dioxide is produced, and more electrons are harnessed.

The electron carriers then bring those electrons into the Electron Transport Chain. The electrons get pulled through the chain and power a turbine-like enzyme called ATP synthase, which produces ATP - the “energy currency” of the cell.

Also fun fact - cellular respiration can also be done with carbohydrates, fats, and proteins! Carbohydrates are derivatives of glucose, so they can be used in respiration after being broken down. Fats are also broken down, and their components can be used in different parts of the respiration steps. Proteins are a little more complicated, since breaking them down results in the production of ammonia, which is eventually removed from the body through your pee.

What is ATP used for? It’s used to drive chemical reactions that require energy. Anabolism is the part of metabolism where larger, more complex molecules are built. If catabolism is like quickly kicking over a built Lego set into pieces, anabolism is meticulously rebuilding a Lego set into a different model.
Different ways to get energy
How many ways have humans produced energy? Many - fossil fuels, burning wood, nuclear energy, or pedaling an electric bike.

Similarly, many organisms on the Earth produce their own energy in different ways than humans. Namely, bacteria! The yeast used to produce beer and bread use a process called fermentation alongside glycolysis. Some bacteria, such as the ones that cause botulism, cannot survive with oxygen - and is a major issue in canned foods. Bacteria swimming on the surface of oceans can survive in salty waters and collect energy from the sun. Bacteria can also live in hydrothermal vents deep in the sea, using sulfur and other inorganic chemicals as a way to respire.

*Monty sunbathing at the only south-facing window in my apartment. Also next to my desk and the food bowl. I like to live dangerously.*

*My friends and I visited a Georgian restuarant in Williamsburg called Cheeseboat. I might be in heaven right now.*
