Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #11**, now halfway into September already! A lot of my happenings recently are longer-term projects, and have been in-flight for weeks. They've also been keeping me much busier than usual. Warning: the word "in-flight" *may* be overused in this week's blog post.

### What I’ve been up to

September has been keeping me busy in New York City. There were some longer-term projects that I've kickstarted after returning from vacation last month, since I don't anticipate travelling much for the next few months.

*I finished a series of miniatures for painting over the past few weekends.* I've accidentally established a tradition to visit game stores while I travel. To support the local business, I typically purchase minis since they can fit in my suitcase. See the "What I've seen" section for the finished result!

*I'm 100 hours into my volunteering in the hospital.* It's been a cool experience to learn about how the hospital works, the different staff involved, and helping the patients. There are times where times were hectic, emotionally difficult, or boring (but hey, I won't complain about the latter). But this experience has been a nice structured activity to offset the vagueness of the gap year.

*I'm continuing to care for my herb garden sprouts.* The [cilantro](https://www.almanac.com/plant/coriander-and-cilantro) and [sage](https://www.almanac.com/plant/sage) sproutlings have been slowly growing in their own pots. I've been following the advice to water only when the soil feels dry, and to give them plenty of sun. Unfortunately, the oregano didn't root well, and it was blown away from a small gust from my window. This is fortunate because...

*I'm planning to house a cat!* It's been a few years since I've been planning for this, since I needed to find an apartment building that allowed cats. I also waited a couple of months after the start of the pandemic, since there was quite a hype for pet adoptions in NYC. After sorting out apartment logistics, I'm in the process of adoption. Fingers crossed!

*I'm planning to write a bigger log about my gap year experience.* While this blog is nice to track my happenings on a bi-weekly cadence, I really wanted to sink my teeth into reflecting the gap year as a whole, and the experiences/knowledge I've gained from it. (If not because otherwise I'll forget what I did beyond the highlights.) Since I'm not halfway through the gap year, this log will be a living document until early next year. As per the warlock-themed blog, I've titled it "Tome of the Gap Year so far.

*But Susanna, there have been other things you've been planning on working on,* you might ask. There are other projects that I dropped due to priority. This month, cat adoption and the CKAD exam will be my focus for this month. Running was something I want to pick up, but the unusually hotter nights have been problematic, so I've settled with more walking until later in the year. There are also some shenanigans that I probably forgot to include in this list.

*Finally, I'm preparing for the CKAD exam scheduled for next week.* I’ve posted [a bonus blog post on CKAD exam prep](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/) last week. Because the post content goes more in-depth in a topic for a smaller audience, I wanted to separate the content out entirely. To distinguish these bonus blog posts, they will have the words “Deep Lore” in the title. These Deep Lore blog posts will not have a set schedule, and the content will be fairly random. I will include the link to the Deep Lore blog post along the regular email newsletter and blog post.

### What I’ve learned

For two blogs posts, I've alluded to [electrical analogies](https://www.warunlock.com/8-into-the-unknown/) and how [the whole concept has eluded me](https://www.warunlock.com/9-refresh-button/). Well, I finally got to the electricity section of the Physics online course and felt like I got a better grasp of it. I'm still midway through the section, and I'm by no means a professional electrician. However, I can say with confidence that I won't accidentally set things on fire due to poor circuits!

Electricity is what brought in the modern era as we see today. Our applilances and technology are powered by this awesome invention. But how does it work?

Electricity boils down to the movement of charges. All matter is made up of atoms, which consist of the positively-charged nucleus and the negatively-charged electrons buzzing around. These charges aren't always fixed in one spot, but can move about in various ways, depending on the type of element and material.

Metals, like copper, are found in wires because they're really good conductors of electricity. On an atomic level, the electrons in metals can freely move around like a "sea of electrons".

### What I’ve seen

Speaking of in-flight projects - one of them was recently completed over the weekend! After purchasing a new set of acrylic paints at a local art store and painting a pair of minis at a time, I was able to finish [a set of dogs ready for adventure](https://steamforged.com/products/dungeons-doggies-volume-3). I swear my painting is marginally better than my photography skills!
