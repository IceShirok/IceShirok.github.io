Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #11**, now halfway into September already! This week’s blog will be a little shorter than usual. A lot of my happenings recently are longer-term projects, and have been in-flight for weeks.

### What I’ve been up to

TBD

Finally, I’ve posted a bonus blog post on CKAD exam prep last week. Because the post content goes more in-depth in a narrower topic, rather than talk about my past two weeks, I wanted to separate the content out entirely. To distinguish these bonus blog posts, they will have “Deep Lore” in the title.

These Deep Lore blog posts will not have a set schedule, and the content will be varied, so I won’t send a dedicated email through the newsletter. Instead, I will include the link to the Deep Lore blog post along the regular email newsletter.

### What I’ve learned

Thank you for reading this blog post! If you have any questions, feedback, etc. - don’t hesitate to send an email through [susanna@warunlock.com](mailto:susanna@warunlock.com)!
