Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #23**! I’ve been enjoying the sights and sounds of New York City while trying to keep myself hydrated and sunburn-free. Meanwhile, the poor cat lets me know that I haven't been spending as much time with him during the weekends.

# What I’ve been up to

I don’t have any big summer trips planned for the summer, which is good with the airline struggles, inflation, and rising gas costs. (Yikes!) I’ve spent my weekends exploring various places around New York City, especially during clear skies. Can you guess where I've taken these photos at? Can you spot some iconic buildings?

# What I’ve learned

This month’s blog post will be around cooking! I’ll run through a bit of history about me and cooking, how I eventually got decent at cooking, and some hot tips. _Warning: you may get real hungry after this section._

## Background

As a small child, I really really didn’t like to cook. By the time I got to college, I barely learned how to make scrambled eggs and mac and cheese (with the help of my best friend’s mom). Fortunately, with the help of roommates with varying degrees of cooking skill and slivers of free time, I’ve learned to master the art of fried rice, spaghetti and meatballs (all with frozen meatballs and jarred sauce), and turkey sandwiches. No ramen for me though!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog23/blog23-snacks.jpg" width="350"></div>

As I began my post-graduation journey in New York City, I of course cut my costs of dining and takeout by cooking regularly. And it turned out that, now with a professional salary, I could buy ingredients that can actually make good food! I slowly but surely got in the cooking practice. My chopping and mincing skills got faster and more efficient. With a little bit of planning, I could make some tender, flavorful meat through overnight seasoning and marinating. I learned recipes through online articles and cookbooks, as well as inspiration from my dining experiences.

It wasn’t until the pandemic that my cooking skills really took off (before I really got into the takeout and delivery train) and I’ve actually took photos of my cooking.

## My Cooking Today

How does my cooking look like now? Well, I’m at a point where **I could improvise a lunch or dinner** with the ingredients in my fridge, given that I have my fridge stocked decently. I also try to follow recipes by **approximations, proportions, and taste**. I don’t have any measuring spoons or measuring cups, so I tend to live on the edge when cooking baking recipes.

I can say that my cuisines of choice are:

- **Chinese, obviously!** I’ve learned to master the [red braised pork (红烧肉)](https://thewoksoflife.com/shanghai-style-braised-pork-belly/) and a couple of other dishes, but my dream is to make the perfect [stirfry garlic string beans](https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-garlic-green-beans/)!
- **American**, as well. I can always get on board with a breakfast for dinner including an egg sandwich or [pancakes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/). I also try my hand on salad bowls for lunch if I’m feeling particularly health-conscious.
- **Mexican**, after I tried to imitate the burritos and burrito bowls I order for takeout. I’ve been able to make a good [black bean recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/refried_black_beans/), and now I can make an entire chimichurri bowl from scratch!
- **Japanese**, if I have all the ingredients ready. I’ve made [Japanese curry](https://www.justonecookbook.com/simple-chicken-curry/), [tempura](https://www.justonecookbook.com/tempura-recipe/), [onigiri](https://www.wandercooks.com/simple-onigiri-recipe/), [chicken katsu](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/72068/chicken-katsu/), and more. (Not sushi though - too much effort in my opinion).

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog23/blog23-dumplings.jpg" width="350"></div>

I’ve also dabbled in other recipes of various cultures such as Greek salad, a [borscht](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/84450/ukrainian-red-borscht-soup/), [Italian carbonara](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/carbonara-em-guanciale-egg-and-pecorino-romano-em-51221420), a [shepherd’s pie](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/easy_shepherds_pie/), and much more.

Strangely, a type of food **I just can’t get right are soups**, partially because I don’t like to drink soup regularly. I’ve been able to make borscht and [beef stew](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/beef-stew-recipe/), but very rarely. I’ve recently been successful with making [miso soup](https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-miso-soup/) from scratch, but they also require a lot of ingredients to have beforehand.

## Hot Cooking Tips

### Eggs are beginner-friendly

My journey into cooking started with my dad teaching me [how to cook eggs](https://www.jonesdairyfarm.com/brinner/how-tos/cook-eggs) - scrambled, hard boiled, over easy, omelette-style, etc. Eggs come cheap and cook fairly quickly, so it’s easy to iterate and practice. There are also many ways to spice up your eggs such as scallions, vegetables, red pepper flakes, ketchup, and avocado. Like drawing, **eggs are a great beginner cooking recipe**!

Soon, you'll realize how many recipes have eggs - for baking, soups, and even sauces! I always have a carton of eggs in my fridge at the ready. (And my cat is happy to get the cardboard carton once the eggs run out.)

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog23/blog23-chinese.jpg" width="350"></div>

### The spice of life

Oh my goodness, how important having the right spices and garnishes are for cooking certain flavors!

- At minimum, I have **salt, sugar, black pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes**. If I’m cooking something really quickly, then these spices will probably be in those recipes. I also have a Cajun spice container that I've bought since my college days and sworn by its utility for many recipes.
- I’ve been taught at an early age that Chinese kitchens always had **scallions, ginger, and garlic** (三剑客). I also have two types of soy sauce, sesame oil, Chinese rice vinegar, white pepper, and sesame seeds. I sometimes have oyster sauce and chicken bouillon, but soy sauce has been sufficient enough.
- Japanese recipes are trickier to get right because of the **specific ingredients** needed such as nori seaweed, bonito flakes, dried anchovies, and Japanese rice wine.
- Any roasting or grilling usually involve **olive oil, lemon juice, and salt**. I also have balsamic vinegar to make a salad dressing.
- Mexican food has its own set of spices that I use - namely **chili powder, cumin, and cayenne powder**.

Once I picked a few specific cuisines to focus on, it made it easier to choose recipes to iterate on, and I didn't end up with a cabinet filled with barely-used spice jars.

### Getting those veggies

With the exceptions of salads, I’ve always preferred to **eat cooked vegetables** over eating vegetables raw. (Celery - yuck!)

**Stirfry** has been the savior of cooked vegetables for me. Pick some good vegetables to stirfry (like bell peppers, green beans, broccoli, etc). Throw some diced scallions, ginger, and garlic into the hot oil to get the flavor in. If you’re partial for meat, throw in some ground pork and soy sauce as well. Then stirfry the vegetables, add some other spices - and boom! (Sometimes, I’ll blanch the stirfry vegetables for a minute before stiryfrying. This was, I don’t burn the vegetables in the attempt to avoid undercooking them.)

**Roasting** has also been an easy cooking skill, since you toss the vegetables with oil and seasoning, then throw the pan of veggies into the oven and let them cook.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog23/blog23-pasta_salad.jpg" width="350"></div>

### Cook hot meat

Meats had been a struggle to cook for me for two reasons:

1. Unless I was making stirfry and dicing the meat, it was really hard for me to know **if the meat was cooked thoroughly**.
2. The meats I’ve cooked tend to turn out **flavorless**, even if I added the spices to the meats in the pan.

For the first point, I learned a cool tip from a second cousin, who is a professional chef, called the [sear roasting method](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-sear-meats/). With an oven-proof skillet, you sear your meat for a few minutes. Then, place the skillet into a heated oven for around 8 minutes. Lastly, place the skillet back to the stovetop and sear the other side of the meat. It’s solved so many of my issues overcooking the surface and undercooking the center!

For the second part, it boiled down to some chemistry and physics that I’ve learned from Salt Fat Acid Heat - **season your meats ahead of time**! Salt should ideally be applied to chicken at least an hour before cooking it, so the salt can penetrate deeper into the chicken. Fish don’t need as much sitting time for seasoning.

### Imitation is flattery

Much of my cooking was derived from attempting to **mimic especially good food** that I’ve eaten at restaurants, takeout, or home cooking. I’ve became pretty good at Mexican food because the burrito shop I loved closed for the first couple of months of the pandemic! And on random Youtube rabbit holes, I've come across some cool cooking recipes.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog23/blog23-carbonara.jpg" width="350"></div>

Indian cuisine is one type where I simply will resign to ordering takeout for. I’ve made chai tea, biryani, and sweet rice pudding. They were all edible, but there were flavors missing from me substituting some ingredients that I could not procure myself. I'll leave this to the professionals.

### Practice practice practice

Of course, **practice makes perfect**. The more you chop, the better you’ll get to chopping. The more you cook the same recipe, the more confident you are to start making tweaks to the recipe based on your preferences.

**Inevitably, you’ll screw up on a recipe** and end up with inedible food. (For me - I undercooked a soft-boiled egg, messed up the roux and now have a milk/cheese soup for [mac and cheese](https://www.momontimeout.com/best-homemade-baked-mac-and-cheese-recipe/), or I mixed up salt for sugar in a [cranberry sauce](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cranberry_sauce/) recipe.) If that piece is an accessory part of your recipe, then at least you still have food to eat. If you mess up an entire meal… well, that’s what frozen meals and takeout are for.

### Keep your kitchen tidy

Lastly, do you part in [food safety](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/food-safety-home)! Make sure your kitchen tools are clean and properly maintained. Wash your produce thoroughly. Wash your chopping boards and tools after handling meats. Store your food properly.

Why? Nothing spells disaster for your cooking journey than [food poisoning or foodborne infections](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/foodborne-germs.html). One Chinese New Year, I've made and ate dumplings where the ground pork had gone bad... and so I didn't make dumplings for the next Chinese New Year.
