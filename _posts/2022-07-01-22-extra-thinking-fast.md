title: Deep Lore - Thinking Fast and Slow
---

Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock - Deep Lore Edition**! This blog post will focus on the book [*Thinking Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow). I had just finished reading the book a few years after wanting to buy the book and two years after receiving the book. I’ve tried to write a succinct summary in a previous blog post, but I felt like it didn’t do the book justice. Even with this deep lore, I would recommend giving the book a read.

At its core, human decision making does a good job of being overconfident and narrow in scope, especially in unfamiliar situations. It’s important to recognize when a situation is unfamiliar or [unconscious bias](https://diversity.ucsf.edu/programs-resources/training/unconscious-bias-training) is likely to occur, and slow your thinking accordingly (if the situation allows it). Slowing your thinking allows one to think about the situation and the options available, which naturally takes a lot more effort and makes you less confident in your decision making.

## The Meta

For reference, there are some courses and books I’ve already completed that helped me digest the book better. I personally think it’s helped color Kahneman’s arguments better, but the book read easily enough for a layman to read through. The topics I’m familiar with include:

- **General psychology.** [Social psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html) is extremely helpful to know in this book, especially with knowledge on famous studies such as the [Stanford Marshmallow Test](https://bingschool.stanford.edu/news/bing-marshmallow-studies-50-years-continuing-research), the [bystander effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bystander-effect), [fundamental attribution error](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/the-fundamental-attribution-error), and more. [Classical](https://www.verywellmind.com/classical-vs-operant-conditioning-2794861) and [biological](https://www.simplypsychology.org/biological-psychology.html) psychology are also useful to know about.
- **Probability and statistics.** This book will emphasize how human decision making disregards statistics if not trained in statistical analysis, especially when not trained in it. One example is [Bayes’ theorem](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/bayes-theorem.html).
- **Game theory.** I think this is useful for thinking about how individual decision making can be influenced in the presence of conflict, or how individual decisions can impact the well-being of a group.
- **Public health.** This book emphasizes how even when statistics are displayed with objective numbers, framing the statistics in certain words can drastically influence a person’s decision making.

# The Two Systems

Kahneman defines the “two systems” of decision making within a human being a fast and intuitive System 1, and a slow and rational System 2.

## System 1

**System 1** is the half that is always listening, assessing, and judging. It pattern matches and steoreotypes. Examples include identifying a spider, assessing the distance of a stop sign, and deciding whether to buy that extra fries when you’re hungry (and the answer is always yes).

It is the intuitive system that helps us humans survive, but also can hinder us with bad judgments. It lets you make decisions quickly, usually by answering a question with an easier question (or a heuristics). System 1 gives you a decision that usually makes you feel confident because it’s easy and familiar (or System 1 alters a hard question to seem so).

It’s important to note that System 1 is shaped by **a person’s individual experience** (conscious or subconscious) formed into a person’s [model of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), and it helps guide a person through unfamiliar situations. Essentially, System 1 attempts to quickly fill in the gaps through associations because we humans hate unfamiliarity. Kahneman shows how this benefits people, and how this can be exploited from a forced smile ([facial feedback hypothesis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5816132/)) to flash imagery (like advertisements).

## System 2

**System 2** is the half that performs complex calculations and other assessments if System 1 can’t figure out the problem. Examples include hard mathematical equations, figuring out sums, and [active learning](https://cei.umn.edu/teaching-resources/active-learning).

It is **a lazy system** - it only does work when prompted, and has a limited battery life before System 1 takes over. (This is why sometimes you make really bad decisions after being mentally exhausted from reading a white paper or doing some other taxing task.) It lays the options on the table, which can cause an [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) and generally lower your confidence in making a decision.

What is the best way to objectively make an important decision within a group? Bring in **a third-party who has a different perspective**. Folks within the group tend to have in-depth, narrow-scope knowledge and thus may be blind to other factors without an outsider perspective.

## Hierarchy of Competence

An idea that kept popping up in my head as I read the book was the [Hierarchy of Competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence). The picture sums the principles of the two systems perfectly.

- **Unconscious incompetence** is dangerous as a beginner. They stumble around, viewing their world with “unknown unknowns” - they don’t know what questions to ask because they aren’t aware of what they don’t know.
- **Conscious incompetence** is where an amateur at least knows their limits. They engage their System 2 to forcibly slow down and learn. They can start asking the questions, even if they don’t know how to seek the answers.
- **Conscious competence** is where the jobber is… well, competent. They can draw experience and engage in problem solving when they encounter an unknown problem. They can ask questions and effectively find the answers themselves. Teachers and coaches often fall under this category because they can explain to amateurs on their competence against incompetence.
- **Unconscious competence** is where the expert falls under. They are so experienced in their niche that their System 1 can pattern match against their realm extremely quickly. Experts may or may not match in teaching, since their expertise has been encapsulated within the realm of System 1, rather than System 2.

## Trigger Warning for Stonk Traders

Certain professionals could be considered “intuitive experts” not because they have a mature System 2, but that years of training and experience has developed a System 1 that can pattern match on the subject matter really, really well. This can include chess masters and chess board configurations, firefighters and situational awareness, and doctors and [differential diagnosis](https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/differential-diagnosis/). However, this assumes the environment these experts work within are relatively stable. (For example, a hospital can be considered controlled chaos in the midst of medical emergencies.)

Other professionals are considered more or less a “professional BS-er” (my made-up term) in the mind of Kahneman, but for rational reasons. Humans are extraordinarily bad in [predicting long-term events](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/affective-forecasting) especially in the face of an unstable and unpredictable environment. The world is too complex, there are too many “unknown unknowns” for any human being to predict, and oftentimes people are [overconfident from their hindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias). This includes entrepreneurs, stock traders, and politicians.

# Decide with the Head vs. Heart

## Emotions and Decisions

As human beings, we’re emotional and instinctive.

Our minds process our surroundings subconsciously, and [negative events tend to provide much more powerful influence](https://www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618). It’s a great mechanism for survival, such as avoiding a dangerous predator or ingesting a poisonous food. However, this can also backfire.

Most poignantly, think about all the mass shootings that have appeared in the news reel recently. Yes, each mass shooting is a tragedy. However, does this prevent you from going about your day to day life? Theoretically, unless you live in a particularly dangerous neighborhood, it shouldn’t. And yet, it does. Subway rider numbers in New York City haven’t recovered to pre-pandemic times due to the recent subway shootings. I’ve admittedly ridden the subway less frequently as a result of the subway shootings, even if I knew that these shootings are statistically rare. I would be more likely to get injured from an automobile accident as a pedestrian or a driver.

Then why is it that people who succeed tend to be optimistic? Kahneman finds that optimistic people tend to not give up in the face of adversity, even at great cost. (That is to say, they’ve failed more times than a pessimistic person has tried in their lives.) I think it’s an oversimplication, but it’s an interesting observation.

## Statistics is Hard

I took a probability and statistics course in college as a requirement for my CS degree. I’ve also taken other courses which relied on statistics such as general psychology, organic chemistry, discrete math, and microbiology. And I can with confidence that **probability and statistics are wholly unintuitive.**

One of the earliest probability questions I’ve been tricked by (by my own dad, no less) was the following:

*I toss a coin 99 times and all coin tosses (which is tossed by a fair coin) have been heads. What is the chance that the next coin toss is a head?*

**The answer is 50%**, because the 100th coin toss is independent of the previous 99 coin tosses, and I didn’t ask “what is the chance of 100 coin tosses of a fair coin to all land heads?” *This is why I don’t gamble.*

I think prob/stat is so unintuitive to humans because:

- Humans are hardwired with System 1 in order to survive. It’s a fast, intuitive system in the midst of independent situations. (You won’t be thinking about the probability that rain will fall today if you’re being threatened by a tiger.)
- Statistics require quite a [lot of domain knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability). For example, how can you know what is the probability of a person dying from COVID-19 without knowing the population to analyze, the particular area that you’re observing, the COVID-19 viral strain, etc.
- Kahneman emphasized how well humans internally make up stories for a series of events that we [confuse as causation.](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--statistics-and-probability/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--correlation-and-causation--lesson) In reality, most things in life is random, or the environment is so complex that we consider it random. Probability and statistics focus on the combination (or permutation!) of random events.

There are just so many important prob/stat concepts things I could list that it just wouldn’t be possible to cover in one blog post. Read the book or take a [more formal prob/stat course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability), and prepare to have your mind blown. BUT If there’s two concepts I would keep in my prob/stat courses, I would choose:

- [The bell curve](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html). In the face of many independent events, most events will land near the average, and extreme events at either end of the spectrum are equally likely to happen. This can also be related to the [regression of the mean](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-regression-to-the-mean-f86f655d9c42?gi=5b5a50dacd6b), or [Occam’s razor](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html) (which is a heuristic).
- [Bayesian probability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bayes-theorem.asp) and the probability of an event based on a “state of knowledge” or a prior. (There are many resources that can explain this way better than me.)

Early in the book, Kahneman seems as though he was judging those who just didn’t have a System 2 trained in statistical analysis. However, Kahneman showed over and over that even experts, who we would believe wouldn’t fall into the trap, are human and can totally fall into the trap.

What’s a fun “aged like milk” topic I’ve read in the book was around formulas. Many experts during Kahneman's time were understandable outraged to have a formula make a decision more reliably than their own, human-curated decision making. Perhaps because of human ego, the lack of humanity within a formula, and the threat of losing one's job. This can be expanded to the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which is essentially advanced statistics that us humans don’t understand 100%. (Trust me, I've taken a Machine Learning course too.) Ten years after the book publication in 2011, and humanity is grappling with the societal consequences of social media algorithms and dehumanizing platforms.

## Framing

Statistics don’t lie, right? Human society would be much better and utopian if we just shoved a graph with lines connecting the dots and some percentages, right? **WRONG.**

As a data engineer and recent completionist of the *Thinking, Fast and Slow* book, I can tell you that a graph is like telling a story curated from your data. A good graph would require:

- Your hypothesis is specific and rational
- The observed system is vetted for any outside influences
- The data collected is reliable and accurate
- The data is analyzed holistically
- The right graph is used to present the data
- The graph supports your discussion that supports your hypothesis
- Et cetera, et cetera...

Or a simpler demonstration from Kahneman:

*If you were a doctor and was going to treat someone with a disease, which of the treatments would you choose?*

*A. Treatment has a 90% chance of recovery.*

*B. Treatment has a 10% mortality rate.*

While both treatments are logically the same, **Treatment A would be more favorable** because of its positive messaging! Many, many chapters drill into this [concept of framing](https://www.simplypsychology.org/framing-effect.html).

I think one of my most favorite psychological perspectives is the [Ecological Systems Theory](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-lifespandevelopment/chapter/contextual-perspectives/). (Coincidentally, I’ve also loved to learn [domain-driven design](https://airbrake.io/blog/software-design/domain-driven-design) in software engineering, nursing as a profession that supplements a dispassionate medicine, and cooking as an expression of culture.) Behavior and decisions cannot be viewed outside the context of a person’s environment (neighborhood, culture, history, etc). We can’t denounce the past for being morally inferior when it’s just us modern people falling for the hindsight bias trick.

Kahneman also notes that the word “rational” is quite complex. While most people think of “rational” as one who frequently engages in System 2 and knows better than to make decisions through impulse and emotions. However, is a person considered rational if they make decisions that align with their model of the world, even [if that model is limited](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-confirmation-bias-2795024)? According to Kahneman, **yes**. Which is why two people can vastly disagree in opinions because they’ve been raised and influenced by different experiences, even if they view the same situation.

This concept of framing is quite amazing but should be used carefully.

- On one side, framing can be detrimentally manipulative. Advertising influences potential customers through sneaky messaging. Politicians prepare speeches that boosts their own credentials while undermining their opponents.
- On the other side, framing can be manipulative, if not to nudge people in the right direction. In reality, most people in any society aren’t studied to recognize and apply good policies. In addition, American society values freedom and loathes authoritarian policies - no one wants to be told what to do. BUT with some crafty framing, people can be nudged into the right direction.

# Living Life

The last section that Kahneman approaches involves the experience and quantification of happiness. It was a section that definitely left me contemplating my own life, as well as how American society handles the definition and support (or lack thereof) of the well-being of its citizens.

Kahneman defines the **experiencing self and the remembering self**. Humans are particularly bad at remembering how they felt in the past moment, since they only remember memories by their intensity, regardless of its duration. (For example, a 7-day vacation at the beach was enjoyable for all but the last day where you get a bad sunburn, so you remember the entire vacation to not be as fun overall.) It questions why people seek exciting vacations or why marriages seem to become miserable as the novelty of marriage fades from memory.

There’s a lot of discussion around what exactly makes a person more or less happy, depending on a wealth of factors.

- Active engagement of activities seem to boost well-being, like socializing and exercising.
- Poverty not only causes a reduction of well-being, but seems to undermine the happiness of engaging in activities.
- Wealth has diminishing returns after a certain limit, most often because you don’t have the time to enjoy spending the money.
- Intensity seems to be the contributing factor to associating a memory to the emotion, regardless of its duration.

Kahneman relates these studies to the development of medical treatments and public policy, which is quite cool. A novel treatment that causes moderate pain for a longer period of time would be more preferable by a patient to a treatment that lasts for a shorter time but causes severe pain, for people will have that memory to retain for the rest of their life. Public policy helps support its citizens with programs and institutions to alleviate common stressors (i.e. child care) and improve well-being.

# Wrapping It Up

Kahneman’s *Thinking Fast and Slow* is a good read for personal or professional knowledge, and will give you a good think about how you and others make decisions with two different systems. It’s why objectively showing the data to others doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you win an argument. It’s why people will choose sure gains and gamble on losses, and not gamble gains or choose sure losses. It provides a glimpse into the conflicts, and perhaps harmony, between human intuition and human intelligence.

I’ve definitely fallen for some fallacies, while managing to overcome other fallacies. There’s no way to train System 1 to stop scanning or System 2 to take over the mind, as detailed in the book through many chapters. Kahneman concludes by advising readers to become more aware of a “cognitive minefield” in an unfamiliar situation, then slowing down and engaging System 2. As with any other skill, it takes practice and experience to build up the mental recognition and fortitude.
