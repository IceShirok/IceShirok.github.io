Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #18**! Not one, but TWO big moments had occurred just after the last blog post, so you MUST read on! (And I know this is quite a clickbait-y description, but I don't want to ruin the surprise.)

### What Iâ€™ve been up to

To break the ice... **I've beaten Dark Souls!** :tada: :tada: :tada:

This was a video game I've heard of for years as being a notoriously hard game. At the time, I could count the number of real-time action games I've played with one hand. After getting some more experience from the COVID-19 pandemic, I've finally ~subjected myself to the torture~ jumped into the Soulsbourne bandwagon. It was definitely a hard game at first, but it becomes satisfying once the mechanics "clicked" in my head. The interconnectedness of the game's geography was also very satisfying to experience. I was able to complete the game just in time for the release of Elden Ring... but I don't have the tech hardware to run it. ðŸª¦

Oh, and **I've gotten a new job!** :tada: :tada: :tada:

Technically, since I've been calling my break from work a "gap year", I was planning to not work for around 12 months. However, the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant had put a stopper to some of my bigger plans earlier this year. With nothing else to really do, I dove back into coding practice and systems design for tech interviews. Needless to say, I've finished the interview process earlier than I expected.

Now I'm happy to be joining Vault Health as a Senior Software Engineer. It's been a heck of a month within the company so far, getting to learn about the tech stack, the business goals, and the culture. It's also been quite exhausting to go through the onboarding process, so it's been plenty of breaks during the weekdays, and a lot of rest and respite with the cat on weeknights.

*Well, this is awkward. What's gonna happen to the War(un)lock blog?* I was debating whether to keep posting blog posts or to stop after April. I've decided to keep this blog around, since it's a nice little public diary that doesn't take much time to write. Plus, I like my current branding and don't want to give up my blog CNAME.

### What Iâ€™ve learned

This is the last of a three-part series of "what we eat" and "why we eat". Previously, I talked about the different kinds of food that we eat and what our bodies use these materials for. Also, we went through the concept of metabolism - food is broken down into smaller components and energy, so that our bodies can build and maintain themselves. And it's all done by teeny tiny cells!

But how does the body know what to build?

#### Central dogma of microbiology

*DNA -> RNA -> Protein*

A tech analogy I always thought was *source code -> byte code -> application*.
* Source code is protected through version control and other restrictions. It is the source of truth for building applications. The entire codebase is used to build a full application, but usually only certain subsets of the codebase is actually compiled to build the relevant module or microservice.
* Byte code is the compiled version of the source code. It is never saved within version control, and is transient in nature. However, it's critical for the byte code to be both correct and trusted to run as an application.
* The application is used to perform a specific task after being built and deployed from byte code.

What are DNA, RNA, and proteins?

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is like the source code of cells. It contains all the instructions needed to build a human being, but most cells are programmed to specialize and express certain genes. In human cells, DNA is protected within the nucleus. It is regularly replicated to maintain copies. Various proteins ensure that the DNA copies are error-free through proofreading and base repairs.

DNA is transcribed into mRNA in order to produce proteins. Why have this intermediary step? DNA is a very, very precious resource, so it must stay in the nucleus. mRNA is a copy of DNA that can be destroyed so that only the right number of proteins are produced. mRNA also has some protective measures so that it can be differentiated from foreign RNA, such as bacterial or viral RNA.

mRNA is then translated into proteins. Imagine mRNA as a very long string of code composed of only 4 bases. A translation machine attaches to the mRNA at the start codon. It then zips through the mRNA and attaches an amino acid based on a 3-set code called a codon. The amino acids are chained until the translation machine hits the stop codon.

#### Enzymes

A protein is a chain of amino acids. There are only about 20 unique amino acids, yet a chain of millions and billions of amino acids can produce a vast variety of proteins. The variations are due to the intermolecular interactions between amino acids... which is honestly still crazy for me to think about! Proteins also have a narrow range of temperature, pH, and salt concentrations in order for them to work properly. If any of these factors are out of balance, then proteins can literally fall apart or be bent out of shape.

Some proteins are called enzymes, which are biological catalysts. Why are these important? There are many chemical processes that can naturally occur but take an obscene amount of time to occur. Catalysts are very cool because they help to speed up the chemical processes, and they are 100% reusable. They really only do one job very, very well.

How do enzymes speed up chemical processes? A chemical reaction has to occur with some number of molecules having enough energy to interact with each other, exchange atoms, and break off as different molecules. Enzymes can help to attract these molecules together (!), arrange these molecules in an optimal position to interact (!!), and force the molecules off the enzyme as soon as the reaction is complete (!!!). The protein is so specific that no other molecules can use the protein in a "lock and key" fashion.

Chemical reactions can also occur more quickly depending on the "route" of the chemical reaction. Think about a roadtrip. It may take a slightly longer trip to drive through some hills around mountains, but it's much easier to do so than to directly climb the mountains to reach the same destination! Similarly, enzymes can help transform molecules into these intermediary steps and eventually to the desired molecule.

Enzymes are so important to the body that the body maintains homeostasis to keep the ideal environment to keep proteins working.

#### Hacking the system

The last thing I wanted to mention is around medicine and lab technology. After reading about how they work, they seem like hacking the body by exploiting the mechanisms at a chemical and cellular level.

PCR may be a term you heard of when testing for COVID-19. It exploits the process of DNA replication in order to exponentially replicate a desired section of DNA.

A prescription drug is a chemical that binds to certain receptors in our body. While the receptors are specific in a "lock and key" fashion, our bodies have so many receptors, we never know what else the drug can do to our bodies. Any drug you consume will have side effects, but the effect and its severity can vary.

Vaccines are a way for our immune system to learn about its enemy without confronting it full force. Some diseases are so deadly that a person may die before their immune system can mount a response... if the immune system hasn't encountered the disease before. A vaccine provides the immune system an antigen (like a signature) without the harmful parts of the disease. The immune system is smart enough to remember the antigen, so it can respond much more quickly in the future.

### What Iâ€™ve seen

This month has been so busy, I've completely forgotten to take many photos in the meanwhile. Oops!
