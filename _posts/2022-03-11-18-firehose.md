Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #18**! Not one, but TWO big moments had occurred just after the last blog post, so you MUST read on! (And I know this is quite a clickbait-y description, but I don't want to ruin the surprise.)

### What Iâ€™ve been up to

To break the ice... **I've beaten Dark Souls!** :tada: :tada: :tada:

This was a video game I've heard of for years as being a notoriously hard game. At the time, I could count the number of real-time action games I've played with one hand. After getting some more experience from the COVID-19 pandemic, I've finally ~subjected myself to the torture~ jumped into the Soulsbourne bandwagon. It was definitely a hard game at first, but it becomes satisfying once the mechanics "clicked" in my head. The interconnectedness of the game's geography was also very satisfying to experience. I was able to complete the game just in time for the release of Elden Ring... but I don't have the tech hardware to run it. ðŸª¦

Oh, and **I've gotten a new job!** :tada: :tada: :tada:

Technically, since I've been calling my break from work a "gap year", I was planning to not work for around 12 months. However, the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant had put a stopper to some of my bigger plans earlier this year. With nothing else to really do, I dove back into coding practice and systems design for tech interviews. Needless to say, I've finished the interview process earlier than I expected.

Now I'm happy to be joining Vault Health as a Senior Software Engineer. It's been a heck of a month within the company so far, getting to learn about the tech stack, the business goals, and the culture. It's also been quite exhausting to go through the onboarding process, so it's been plenty of breaks during the weekdays, and a lot of rest and respite with the cat on weeknights.

*Well, this is awkward. What's gonna happen to the War(un)lock blog?* I was debating whether to keep posting blog posts or to stop after April. I've decided to keep this blog around, since it's a nice little public diary that doesn't take much time to write. Plus, I like my current branding and don't want to give up my blog CNAME.

### What Iâ€™ve learned

This is the last of a three-part series of "what we eat" and "why we eat". Previously, I talked about the different kinds of food that we eat and what our bodies use these materials for. Also, we went through the concept of metabolism - food is broken down into smaller components and energy, so that our bodies can build and maintain themselves. And it's all done by teeny tiny cells!

But how does the body know what to build?

#### Central dogma of microbiology

*DNA -> RNA -> Protein*

#### Enzymes

#### Hacking the system

### What Iâ€™ve seen

This month has been so busy, I've completely forgotten to take many photos in the meanwhile. Oops!
