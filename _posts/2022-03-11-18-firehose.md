Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #18**! Not one, but TWO big moments had occurred just after the last blog post, so you MUST read on! (And I know this is quite a clickbait-y description, but I don't want to ruin the surprise.)

Meanwhile, enjoy a derp cat who loves shoes.

### What Iâ€™ve been up to

To break the ice... **I've beaten Dark Souls!** :tada: :tada: :tada:

Dark Souls was a video game I've heard of for years as being [a notoriously hard game](https://gamerant.com/dark-souls-ranked-hardest-bosses/). At the time, I could count [the number of](https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3) [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Republic_Commando) [action games](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) I've played with one hand. After getting some more experience from the COVID-19 pandemic, I've finally ~subjected myself to the torture~ jumped into the bandwagon. It was definitely a hard game at first, but it became satisfying once the mechanics "clicked" in my head. The interconnectedness of the game's geography was also very satisfying to experience. I was able to complete the game just in time for the [release of Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring)... but I don't have the tech hardware to run it. ðŸª¦

Oh, and **I've gotten a new job!** :tada: :tada: :tada:

Technically, since I've been calling my break from work a "gap year", I was planning to not work for around 12 months. However, the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant had put a stopper to some of my bigger plans earlier this year. With nothing else to really do, I dove back into coding practice and systems design for tech interviews. Needless to say, I've finished the interview process earlier than I expected.

Now I'm happy to be joining [Vault Health](https://www.vaulthealth.com) as a Senior Software Engineer (TM). It's been a heck of a month within the company so far, getting to learn about the tech stack, the business goals, and the culture. Of course, it's also been exhausting to get back into the whirlwind that is the tech industry. It's been plenty of breaks during the weekdays, and a lot of rest and respite with the cat on weeknights.

*Well, this is awkward. What's gonna happen to the War(un)lock blog?* I was debating whether to keep posting blog posts or to stop after April. I've decided to keep this blog around, since it's a nice little public diary / knowledge dump that doesn't take much time to write. Plus, I like my current branding and don't want to give up my blog CNAME.

### What Iâ€™ve learned

This is the last of a three-part series of ["what we eat"](https://www.warunlock.com/16-peppermint-mocha/) and ["why we eat"](https://www.warunlock.com/17-eye-of-the-tiger/). Previously, I talked about the different kinds of food that we eat and what our bodies use these materials for. Also, we went through the concept of metabolism - food is broken down into smaller components and energy, so that our bodies can build and maintain themselves. And it's all done by teeny tiny cells!

But how does the body know what to build in the first place? And how does the body build things? Well, I can't answer that in one blog post, but I can certainly go through the basics!

#### Central dogma of molecular biology

*DNA -> RNA -> Protein* is [the central dogma of microbiology](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_Introductory_Biology_(CK-12)/04%3A_Molecular_Biology/4.01%3A_Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biology). It was first coined by [Francis Crick less than 100 years ago](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5602739/), and yet has changed the perspective of how life, well, "worked".

**DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)** contains all the instructions needed to build a human being. Most cells are programmed to specialize and [express certain genes](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-gene-expression) (i.e. muscle cells vs. neurons). In human cells, DNA is protected within the nucleus, where it is regularly replicated to maintain copies. Various proteins ensure that the DNA [copies are error-free through proofreading and base repairs](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-damage-repair-mechanisms-for-maintaining-dna-344/).

DNA is **transcribed** into mRNA, which are used to produce proteins. Why have this intermediary step? [DNA is a very, very precious resource](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-biology1/chapter/cell-cycle-checkpoints/), so it resides in the nucleus. mRNA is a copy of DNA that can be destroyed so that protein activity is regulated. Proteins are expensive to make, so cells want to produce only the necessary amount to build and maintain itself. [mRNA is also processed with protective measures](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/transcription-and-rna-processing/a/eukaryotic-pre-mrna-processing) so that it can be differentiated from foreign genetic material, such as bacterial or viral RNA.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog18/cell_boundary.jpeg" width="500"></div>

[mRNA is then **translated** into proteins.](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Translation) Imagine mRNA as a very long string of code composed of only 4 bases. A ribosome (the translation machine) attaches to the mRNA at a start marker. The ribosome then zips through the mRNA and attaches an amino acid based on a 3-set code called a codon. The amino acids are chained until the ribosome hits the stop marker. The translation machine disassembles, and the protein has been produced.

A protein is a chain of amino acids that twists and turns into a particular shape. [There are only about 20 unique amino acids in total](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557845/), yet thousands of proteins can be derived from chains of amino acids. (I personally loved learning about [the Titin protein](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Protologisms/Long_words/Titin).) Protein variations are [due to the intermolecular interactions between amino acids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6995338/) that form such twists and turns... which is honestly still crazy for me to think about!

Proteins have a narrow range of temperature, pH, and salt concentrations in order for them to work properly. If any of these factors are out of balance, then [proteins can fall apart or be bent out of shape, rendering them useless](http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/568denaturation.html). Proteins are so important to the body that [the body maintains homeostasis](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-homeostasis-2795237) to keep that ideal environment to keep proteins working.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog18/translation.jpeg" width="500"></div>

A tech analogy I always thought about the dogma was *source code -> byte code -> application*.
* **Source code** is protected through version control and other restrictions. It is the source of truth for building applications. The entire codebase is used to build a full application, but usually only certain subsets of the codebase is actually compiled to build the relevant module or microservice.
* **Byte code** is the compiled version of the source code. It is never saved within version control, and is transient in nature. However, it's critical for the byte code to be both correct and trusted to run as an application.
* **The application** is used to perform a specific task after being built and deployed from byte code. It usually requires an intepreter to execute the byte code.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog18/dogma_analogy.jpeg" width="500"></div>

#### Enzymes

In the previous blog posts, I've mentioned that proteins acted like tiny machines used to perform certain tasks. Their activity is regulated by gene expression highlighted above (for the tech saavy, something like autoscaling). Why are they so important to metabolism?

Remember how metabolism involves a bunch of chemical reactions? There are many chemical processes that can naturally occur but take an obscene amount of time to occur, or are impossible to do without a massive boost of energy. There is a chemistry term called catalysts, which help speed up the chemical processes, and they are 100% reusable. They only do one job very, very well. Proteins which act like catalysts are called [enzymes, which are biological catalysts](https://www.britannica.com/science/enzyme). You may have seen the names of enzymes - they end with the **suffix `-ase`.**

Take for example [hydrogen peroxide and catalase](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/57). Hydrogen peroxide is toxic to cells. And yet, it is [a byproduct when cells perform aerobic respiration](https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2009174)! Hydrogen peroxide can naturally break down into water and oxygen, but [an open bottle of hydrogen peroxide will take several weeks to "expire"](https://www.healthline.com/health/does-hydrogen-peroxide-expire). Cells produce the enzyme catalase, an "antioxidant", to break down hydrogen peroxide before the chemical can cause harm to the cell through free radical oxidation.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog18/catalase.jpeg" width="500"></div>

*How do enzymes speed up chemical processes?* A chemical reaction has to occur with some number of molecules having enough energy to interact with each other, exchange atoms, and break off as different molecules. This is important because atoms and molecules are very tiny, and don't always bump into each other. Enzymes can help to attract these molecules together (!), arrange these molecules in an optimal position to interact with each other (!!), and force the molecules off the enzyme as soon as the reaction is complete (!!!). The enzyme interacts with only very specific substrates in a ["lock and key" fashion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9921/), which are enforced by intermolecular forces.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog18/lock_key.jpeg" width="500"></div>

Chemical reactions can also occur more quickly by changing [the "route" of the chemical reaction](https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/chapter/12-7-catalysis/). Think about a roadtrip. It may take a slightly longer trip to drive through some hills and cities around the mountains, but it's much easier to do so than to directly climb the mountains to reach the same destination! Similarly, enzymes can help transform molecules through intermediary steps, then transform the intermediary to the desired molecule. (For the tech-saavy, think of [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/).)

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog18/routes.jpeg" width="500"></div>

#### Hacking the system

Why do we care about the details of `the central dogma of molecular biology`? Medicine and lab technology use that knowledge similar to "hack" biological processes - exploiting mechanisms at a chemical and cellular level to produce a desired effect.

[Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Polymerase-Chain-Reaction-Fact-Sheet) may be a term you heard of when testing for COVID-19. It exploits the process of DNA replication in order to exponentially replicate a desired section of DNA. For example, the [SARS-COV-2 virus has its own unique RNA sequence](https://www.parkerici.org/the-latest/an-immunologist-breaks-down-covid-19/) which is reverse transcribed into DNA. If someone was infected with COVID-19, the PCR test should be able to amplify that DNA segment until it is detectable; otherwise, no DNA should be present.

A prescription drug is a chemical that binds to certain receptors in our body. Receptors activate certain processes through a "lock and key" system similarly to enzymes. Our bodies have so many receptors, we never know what else the drug can do to our bodies as unintentional side effects. Any drug you consume will have side effects, but [the effect and its severity can vary, which is why it's carefully tested](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-studies/learn).

#### Summary

In this three-part series, we've learned:
* What kinds of food and drink we need to survive, viewed in the viewpoint of biochemistry and health.
* Metabolism and the process of breaking down substances to harness energy and build other substances.
* The importance of enzymes as biological machines, and how they are produced at a cellular level.
* How the understanding of such mechanisms help build tools and technologies to keep us healthy.

Next blog post, I may talk more about the idea of toxins. I always thought it weird that we humans can eat chocolate, but our pets will die if they eat chocolate. Why is that? Tune in next month!
