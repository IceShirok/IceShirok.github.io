Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #25**! I’m spending more time at home than usual, and it’s not because I’ve gotten sick. (Well, I was writing this blog at bed while I’m sick.) Read more to learn why!

# What I’ve done

Well the cat’s out the bag (or out the carrier after a combined 8 hour trip) - I’ve moved to Raleigh, NC! (wao)

It’s been an eventful 3 months cumulating into a fairly stressful two-day adventure chauffering my confused cat from New York City to Raleigh. However, I can say that I have a roof above my head, a decently-stocked kitchen, and grappling with car ownership.

*Why Raleigh?* In the long-term, I knew that I would eventually move out of the Northeast. Many friends and family live in the Southeast or the West Coast, and I wasn’t going to move to the West Coast. I was also more accustomed to the warm and humid weather, as well as more sunlight during the winter months. Finally, it’s just so much cheaper to live down here. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

# What I’ve learned

Usually in this section, I would go in a ramble about some topic I’ve learned in such detail that no ordinary human being really should learn to derive a terse life lesson like:

- How to stay cool in the summer, while [I learned about all the thermodynamics and physics around it](https://www.warunlock.com/9-refresh-button/).
- How exercise is good for your health because your body needs oxygen to feed your cells, and what better way to get that sweet sweet oxygen is [a better blood pumper called the heart](https://www.warunlock.com/3-rite-of-spring/).

You get it.

But I have to talk about moving logistics.

Why? I’ve lived in New York City for 6 years, having lived in a total of four different apartments. Finding the right apartment required:
- years of exploring the city and figuring out what I liked,
- a scrutinizing eye on an apartment that you have to know you want the moment you step into it, and
- the willingness to saw off an arm and a leg to pay all the application fees on top of a security deposit and first month’s rent.

If you can make it in New York City, you can make it anywhere - including apartment rentals.

Moving interstate has been a different challenge for me, some parts easier but other parts way harder. This year has also provided unusual circumstances, such as microchip shortages, economic uncertainty, COVID-19 restrictions relaxing, and more. Also, I have a cat who doesn’t like anything to do with traveling. Well, he can sense when he’s staying at a pet-friendly hotel anyways.

## Research and prep work

All the prep work that I’ve done over the past 3 months had retroactively been a lifesaver as I traveled to Raleigh and finished most of my post-moving shenanigans in a short period of time.

If you don’t know me, I’m the type of lady who needs a checklist. And boy [did I have a checklist of moving things](https://www.moving.com/move-planner/). In fact, I had an entire Notion master doc for moving logistics because there was just a lot of small but important things to do. (When should I handle utilities? How far in advance should I start looking at potential apartments? Should I fly or should I drive?) One big savior of mine was [using the Notion calendar](https://www.notion.so/help/calendars). It was helpful to organize time-sensitive tasks in a calendar and only worry about a very small number of tasks to do at a given day.

I didn’t have much time to travel to North Carolina, so most of my apartment and car research had been done online. I combined my apartment must-haves (like being pet friendly or having walkable areas) and nice-to-haves (in-unit washer and dryer or having a balcony), then set myself to websites such as [Apartments.com](http://Apartments.com) and [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com). It took a great deal of imagination and Google Maps noodling to narrow down my search field before I scheduled appointment after appointment.

While I did most of my research online, nailing down an apartment lease and car deal ultimately boiled down to an in-person trip to Raleigh. Even in our more online world, I had much more serendipitous outcomes from my flurry of in-person meetings and appointments. My final apartment lease wasn’t listed on the website, but hit almost every single feature I wanted in an apartment. All of my car negotiations couldn’t have happened unless I had dropped in a car dealership looking like a deer in headlights.

And my reward? I spent a few weeks before my move **completely relaxed** - packing, visiting friends, and savoring the local restaurants before I left. Arriving at Raleigh simply involved exchanging paperwork for my new shiny keys.

## Car hunting

The car market is *insane*. I’ve talked to every dealer I’ve met to query for cars, and every dealer mentioned how insane the car market is. And this is for a vanilla Toyota Corolla.

- Every new car is pre-sold. You put a deposit on a car that is being built in the factory and wait 6-8 weeks for it to come to the dealership.
- Every used car is more expensive than its new car equivalent, because why not mark up the price for availbility? I had originally wanted to buy a used car, but decided that I had enough money saved up to buy a new car. Gotta get that new car smell!
- Want a hybrid car? Forget about it. Wait on a months-long or year-long waitlist and slap on an extra $20k at minimum.

With this aggressive seller-favored market, I couldn’t be too picky beyond shopping between dealerships. I managed to shave off a few hundred dollars off some unnecessary features, and I settled with a silver coat color over some more preferable blue shades.

Again, with some phone calls and good advice from my parents, I was able to secure my car within hours of arriving in Raleigh. (The car arrived over a week earlier than anticipated!) I had all of my paperwork and auto insurance ready, and had just enough mental fortitude to read through the fine print from the dealership to get everything settled without much headache. Now to get the license plate…

## Cat shenanigans

My cat Monty complicated moving quite a lot more than I realized. There was no question that I would bring Monty to North Carolina. (I had learned the previous owner had moved to Hawaii and didn’t bring Monty along.) He’s a big cat - too big to fit underneath an airplane cabin seat - and I didn’t want him to be shuffled around in airline cargo. So Monty and I spent two days on an 8-hr roadtrip from NYC to NC.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog25/blog25-moving_out.jpg" height="350"></div>

*Above: All of my furniture has been moved out of the apartment. Monty grapples with confusion.*

The roadtrip required some prep work, such as:

- Renting a car way ahead of time. (Don’t tell the rental company.)
- Getting a stockpile of food and supplies for the roadtrip and the new apartment.
- Giving Monty a bit of anti-anxiety meds to make both of our lives easier.
- Finding a pet-friendly hotel with relatively secure parking, since I had many essential apartment stuff in the car. (BTW, Hilton had the best customer service while I was pulling my hair out from stress.)

And now he’s settled in (and what I mean by that, I mean he’s been snooping into every cabinet that he can paw on). I’m planning to build a catio for him to chill and appreciate the outdoors - at the convenience of his own home!

## Internet provider hell

If there’s anything that I hated the most out of the moving journey, it was *managing my internet service* for the two apartments. Nothing does it like:

- Spending 5 minutes max waiting for a representative and transferring my Internet service between apartments.
- Finding out a couple of minutes after the call that my Internet transfer service tacked on an upgrade I didn’t want.
- Spending two days calling back customer service and waiting at least 20 minutes each call for a representative. (I had to hang up because I had to run to a meeting or start focusing on deep work.)
- Was told by customer service that the billing department handled upgrade management, and had my transfer call dropped twice.
- Spending 40 minutes with a representative from the billing department working through the upgrade cancellation. It was rife with promotional deals that I didn’t want, telling the representative that “NO I’m not going to let the order process because it’ll be even bigger hell to fix it later”, and trying really hard not to cry on the phone from frustration. (But the representative and I did bond over our cats while she was processing my request.)
- Got cold called for more promotional deals before I tried to politely ask to be placed in the Do Not Call list.
- Receiving an email that my Internet service was canceled because the last agent put my start date on the date that I called, rather than the requested date. So I called back to reinstate my service.
- Receiving the order where there was YET another upgrade I didn’t request. I called back and finally got it straightened out. Finally. I’m writing this blog in the Internet that I’m satisfied with.

```
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ <-- me tableflipping at how the agent got the request wrong

┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) <-- me calming down, thinking maybe I wasn't direct or thorough enough

┻━┻︵ \(°□°)/ ︵ ┻━┻ <-- nope, it's the agents
```

## Enjoy NYC while I could

To end the blog on a high note, I spent the last couple of weeks in New York City enjoying the summer city life. I’ve visited several places throughout the tri-state area - some that I’ve frequented often, while others were a first-time experience.

But nothing felt more bittersweet than to appreciate the day-to-day routine that made NYC life unique:

- Being able to walk 5 minutes to a bodega to get a sandwich and soda.
- Hauling my dirty clothes to a laudromat and making sure I had enough quarters in my coinpurse.
- Getting a good ol’ bagel with a schmear of cream cheese.
- Complaining with NYC coworkers about anything related to construction (loud), radiators (loud), or the summer heatwares (which involved AC units, which were loud too).
- Happy hours at bars and restaurants that open past midnight and being able to return home safely through the subway.
- Admiring the walk - whether it be through browstone, skyscrapers, the Gowanus canal, or the rivers that surround Manhattan.
- Any person of any walk of life walking down the street. I’ve taken it for granted so much that visiting friends had to point it out to me.
- Any cuisine you can think of is probably run by a small business in an almost literal hole in the wall.
- Seeing Monty get super excited about the pigeons that perch by the living room windows. (Unfortunately no pigeons around my current apartment, but he gets to experience different sights and sounds.)

# What I’ve seen

I’ve decided to pick a photo in NYC for each year I’ve been in the Big Apple. Enjoy!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog25/blog25-domo_kun.jpg" height="350"></div>

**2017**: I didn't have a lot of photos in 2017, so I took a picture of when I purchased Domo-kun in Tokyo. I've touted Domo with me through my years in NYC on my backpack, and even gotten compliments from strangers!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog25/blog25-nycc.jpg" height="350"></div>

**2018**: A photo with Travis Willingham in New York Comic Con (NYCC). I've been a fan since I was 14 and was able to meet him after around 10 years!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog25/blog25-cold_spring.jpg" height="350"></div>

**2019**: A panoramic view of the mountains by Cold Spring as some coworkers and I hiked on a weekend.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog25/blog25-mannequin_arms.jpg" height="350"></div>

**2020**: Mannequin arms in Fish's Eddy. I took this picture in January 2020, a few months before NYC experienced a full city lockdown.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog25/blog25-monty_box.jpg" height="350"></div>

**2021**: It's Monty! My gap year had started in May 2021, and I had adopted Monty at the end of September of the same year. Cheers to years of more derp!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog25/blog25-bodega_cat.jpg" height="350"></div>

**2022**: A bodega cat in a pet store. At the end of the day, it's the small things in NYC that I've come to really appreciate.
