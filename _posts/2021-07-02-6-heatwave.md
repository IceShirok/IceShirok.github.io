Hi folks, welcome to War(un)lock where the summer heat has turned up 110%.


### What I’ve been up to
Since my last blog, I’ve traveled up to Portland (Maine!) and Boston for a vacation outside of New York City. I rented a car and drove up to Portland where I enjoyed seafood, went on a hike, and learned all about shipwrighting through the [Maine Maritime Museum](https://www.mainemaritimemuseum.org). (No joke, lobster roll prices [skyrocketed to $35 market price](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000850663/the-year-we-learned-to-cook-seafood-at-home-and-sent-prices-soaring). I did end up eating a cheaper Maine lobster roll for the trip.) After visiting Boston to visit friends and explore the city, I drove back down to New York City and… was greeted by a roiling heatwave.

The heatwave has thrown a lot of my exercise plans down the drain, as the heat and humidity made it miserable and dangerous to run. I would wake up earlier in the morning to go for a walk when it’s relatively cool outside. If I needed to be outside, I could excuse myself to try out a new shop and get a life-saving cold drink. My fridge was now stocked with fruits to cool me down, while also being a nutritious snack or dessert. It was also a good time to resume refining my art skills or brushing up on my Chinese language skills. And of course, I also had the YouTube rabbit hole to entertain me.

Over the month of July, I’m planning to continue cooking while exploring new restaurants (as weather permits) in NYC. I’m coordinating with other peeps on travel plans so we can meet up. I would love to try out in-person cooking or art lessons, but the travel plans have thrown a wrench in those plans. I suppose it’s more YouTube tutorials and practice in the meanwhile.


### What I’ve learned

I’ve been brushing back up on my (Mandarin) Chinese language skills recently. The hospital that I’m volunteering in has a relatively larger percentage of Chinese patients. The majority of the patients are more comfortable speaking Cantonese than Mandarin, but it’s much easier to interact with them through Mandarin than English. I’ve been having a harder time finding resources to learn Cantonese, so I figured it would be more beneficial to boost my existing Mandarin skills.

#### What resources have I been using?

* YouTube is super useful for searching videos with Chinese speakers. Content can range from cooking tutorials, vlogs, makeup tutorials, free dramas (i.e. Tencent), and more. Videos made by YouTube content creators tend to be easier for me to pick up by ear. Production-level shows are harder for me to understand due to more advanced vocabulary, so I often read Chinese subtitles, or English subtitles if I’m really struggling.
* I already have [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net) on my smartphone. It’s a simple notecard-style tool that utilizes spaced repetition so I don’t forget vocabulary.
* I’ve been exploring some options for group lessons or tutors. NYC-based [Beautiful Chinese](https://www.beautifulmandarin.com) is an interesting organization because they do have an eBook trial, and includes Chinese terminology for different NYC boroughs and neighborhoods. I wanted to do some self-learning in between travel before I commit to formal lessons.

#### Interesting detour around culture

I came across a U.S. government resource called [So You’re an American?](https://www.state.gov/courses/answeringdifficultquestions/html/app.htm?p=module1_p1.htm). It goes into detail on what culture and context mean, broad themes on American culture, and how to respond to difficult cultural questions around American culture - all with cute graphics and interactive modules. I especially enjoyed (re-)learning about [high-context vs. low-context cultures](https://www.state.gov/courses/answeringdifficultquestions/html/app.htm?p=module3_p3.htm) and how miscommunication can happen between two people - even though they both believe they’re right!

American culture is considered a low-context culture, while Chinese culture is considered a high-context culture. After some digging, I found an article [Australian Cultural Atlas on Chinese culture](https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/chinese-culture/chinese-culture-core-concepts#chinese-culture-core-concepts) that details the broad characteristics of Chinese culture. It was also fun to search for and read about other cultures like an astrology zodiac. However, the way the cultures are presented in text format was extremely… dry and analytical. Short of full immersion into the culture, YouTube helps tremendously with brushing up on both the language and cultural front in a much more entertaining fashion.

#### Some spooky coincidences

The day after I had found the culture comparison articles, I overheard a nurse helping someone’s Korean father navigate diet adjustments to improve his health. The nurse emphasized that the patient’s culture is very important to consider, especially when it comes to food. While the patient typically ate Korean fried food everyday, the nurse said it would likely be impossible to have him stop eating the fried food cold turkey and sustain it long enough to see health benefits.

I also recently read “[Crying in H-Mart](https://www.amazon.com/Crying-Mart-Memoir-Michelle-Zauner/dp/0525657746)”, a memoir written by Michelle Zauner as she discussed her relationship with her mother and her ties to her Korean heritage through food.
