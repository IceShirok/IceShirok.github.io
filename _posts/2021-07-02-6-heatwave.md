Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock** where the summer heat has turned up 120% as of time of writing this blog post. I've now been 2 months into my gap year, and it's been an overall relaxing and introspective experience so far. The leap to go forward with a gap year is definitely scarier than actually doing it, once I settled my financial and logistical situation.


### What I’ve been up to

Since my last blog, I’ve traveled up to Portland (Maine!) and Boston for a vacation outside of New York City. I rented a car and drove up to Portland where I enjoyed [a bit pricier seafood than usual](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000850663/the-year-we-learned-to-cook-seafood-at-home-and-sent-prices-soaring), went on a hike, and learned all about shipwrighting through the [Maine Maritime Museum](https://www.mainemaritimemuseum.org). After visiting Boston to visit friends and explore the city, I drove back down to New York City and… was greeted by a roiling heatwave.

The heatwave has thrown a lot of my exercise plans down the drain, as the heat and humidity made it miserable (and dangerous at times) to run. To compensate, I would wake up earlier in the morning to go for a walk when it was relatively cool outside. If I needed to be outside, I could excuse myself to try out a new shop and get a life-saving cold drink. My fridge was now stocked with fruits to cool me down, while also being a nutritious snack or dessert. At the very least, if it's harder to exercise and improve my cardiovascular health, I could [adjust my diet after a bout of ice cream and fried fish](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/3/16845438/exercise-weight-loss-myth-burn-calories).

While I was cooping in my apartment, it was also a good time to resume refining my art skills or brushing up on my Chinese language skills. And of course, I also had the YouTube rabbit hole to entertain me. This month, I’m planning to continue cooking while exploring new restaurants (as weather permits) in NYC. I’m coordinating with other peeps on travel plans so we can meet up. I would love to try out in-person cooking or art lessons, but required a few months' commitment. I suppose it’s more self-learning through YouTube tutorials and practice in the meanwhile.


### What I’ve learned

#### Brushing up on Mandarin Chinese

I’ve been brushing back up on my (Mandarin) Chinese language skills recently. There are two main reasons why:
1) In the near future, I'm planning to take a proper extended trip out to China to visit relatives and generally enjoy the area. I also haven't been to Taiwan, so I'm planning to visit there as well. Perhaps more countries will be added to my list later this year!
2) The hospital that I’m volunteering in has a relatively larger percentage of Chinese patients. The majority of the patients are more comfortable speaking Cantonese than Mandarin, but it’s much easier to interact with them through Mandarin than English. I’ve been having a harder time finding resources to learn Cantonese, so I figured it would be more beneficial to boost my existing Mandarin skills.

I've been using the following resources:

* YouTube has been useful for searching videos with Chinese speakers. Content can range from cooking tutorials, vlogs, makeup tutorials, free dramas (i.e. [腾讯视频Tencent](https://www.youtube.com/c/腾讯视频Tencent)), and more. Videos made by YouTube content creators tend to be easier for me to pick up by ear, since they talk in an informal and conversational level. Production-level shows are harder for me to understand due to the more advanced or esoteric vocabulary. In this instance, I often read the Chinese subtitles provided, or add English subtitles if I’m really struggling.
* I already have [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net) on my smartphone from college. It’s a simple notecard-style tool that utilizes spaced repetition so I don’t forget the vocabulary I've learned.
* I’ve been exploring some options for group lessons or tutors. NYC-based [Beautiful Chinese](https://www.beautifulmandarin.com) is an interesting organization because they do have an eBook trial, and includes Chinese terminology for different NYC boroughs and neighborhoods. I wanted to do some self-learning in between travel before I commit to formal lessons.

#### An analytical view of culture

I came across a U.S. government resource called [So You’re an American?](https://www.state.gov/courses/answeringdifficultquestions/html/app.htm?p=module1_p1.htm). It goes into detail on what culture and context mean, broad themes on American culture, and how to respond to difficult cultural questions around American culture. The website also includes cute graphics and interactive modules. I especially enjoyed (re-)learning about [high-context vs. low-context cultures](https://www.state.gov/courses/answeringdifficultquestions/html/app.htm?p=module3_p3.htm). The main thing to note is how miscommunication can happen between two people - even though they both believe they’re right - due to cultural differences.

American culture is considered a low-context culture, while Chinese culture is considered a high-context culture. I wanted to dig more into the broad strokes of Chinese culture, so I found an article [Australian Cultural Atlas on Chinese culture](https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/chinese-culture/chinese-culture-core-concepts#chinese-culture-core-concepts). It was also fun to search for and read about other cultures like an astrology zodiac. However, the way the cultures are presented in text format was extremely… dry and analytical. Short of full immersion into the culture, YouTube has helped tremendously with brushing up on both the language and cultural front in a much more entertaining fashion. (And definitely not an excuse to watch too many videos at a time.)

#### Culture and food

Chinese cooking vlogs have been a helpful resource to learn Chinese, as well as learn how to cook authentic recipes. (This includes the lack of precise ingredient measurements!) Some are recipes that I've eaten as a homecooked meal, while others are restaurant-style recipes that I try to replicate. I don't have a sensitive sense of taste, but [salt and oil definitely makes things taste better](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com)!

I recently read “[Crying in H-Mart](https://www.amazon.com/Crying-Mart-Memoir-Michelle-Zauner/dp/0525657746)”, a memoir written by Michelle Zauner as she discussed her relationship with her mother and her ties to her Korean heritage through food. The feelings of nostalgia through food is definitely relatable, and I can already see myself in H-Mart or a Chinese grocery store.

Coincidentally, I also overheard a nurse helping someone’s Korean father navigate diet adjustments to improve his health. The nurse emphasized that the patient’s culture is very important to consider, especially when it comes to food. While the patient typically ate Korean fried food everyday, the nurse said it would likely be impossible to have him stop eating the fried food cold turkey and sustain it long enough to see health benefits.

That is to say, food is strongly deeply ingrained in a culture and a person!
