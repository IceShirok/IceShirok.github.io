Hi folks, welcome back to **War(un)lock** blog #4. I’ve officially completed a full month of my gap year, and boy has time flown quickly!

### What I’ve been up to

The past two weeks have been relatively uneventful, or at least what I perceive to be relatively uneventful. NYC has bounced between a scorching hot 90ºF to a rainy 40ºF on Memorial Day Weekend, which left me to stay indoors more often than I would like to. However, it was a good opportunity to sip on some (iced) tea, take online courses, doodle a sketch, or just chill. It was a good reminder to know that even with the plans and schedules that I’ve set up, there are times to bend the rules on occasion.

On one of the days that I could hit that sweet spot of 60º weather, I was able to jog a total of 10 kilometers in 3 25-minute intervals, which is a personal record for me! The last 2 miles were rough as I was literally hitting an uphill battle, but I did achieve the jog in 74 minutes. I haven’t been able to achieve those results consistently, but I’m happy to go out for a walk or jog whenever I’m not getting baked or frozen.

As NYC businesses start to plan street block community events, I’ve also been starting to plan more events for the next few months, both within and without NYC. (It didn’t help when some of the YouTube videos I’ve watched were travel vlogs, so the wanderlust has been stoked.) Stay tuned!

### What I’ve learned

During a heat spell in NYC, I found that my apartment was utterly lacking in ice cream. I did have leftover ingredients that let me make [my own strawberry ice cream](https://www.food.com/recipe/ice-cream-in-a-bag-340766).

I remember making my own ice cream in an elementary school class, where my ice cream ended up becoming a super salty flavor of vanilla. I made sure to double- and triple-check that no salt would leak into the cream this time around. The final product was still a little runny, but it was delicious ice cream nonetheless.

As I munched on my sweet creation, I had to know - why does shaking a bag of ice and salt surrounding a mixture of heavy cream and sugar create the goodness that is ice cream?

The heavy cream needs a lower temperature than 32ºF, as well as aeration, to solidify into creamy ice cream. Salt added into the ice allows the water to achieve a colder temperature than 32ºF. This phenomenon is due to “colligative properties”, specifically “freezing point depression”.

At that point, those terms tossed me into a rabbit hole. Especially [re: me reading this article](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Solutions_and_Mixtures/Colligative_Properties/Freezing_Point_Depression). What makes water stay colder without freezing when adding salt?

Water is known as the “universal solvent”. When water freezes, the water molecules rearrange themselves in a regular pattern. This same regular pattern increases the volume of ice, and is what allows ice to float on water.

In [freezing point depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing-point_depression), when a substance is dissolved (solute) into water (solvent), the solute particles interferes with the water particles’ ability to rearrange into that regular pattern when freezing. Lowering the temperature, or removing more energy from the water, would be needed for the water particles to pack into a solid. (Note that this phenomenon happens with any proper solution, but a solution of water and salt is very common.)

This same property is also why rock salt and sand are tossed on the streets - to prevent ice from forming unless it is obscenely cold outside.

I [wouldn’t recommend adding sand or other commercial street defrosters to the homemade ice cream recipe though](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-make-ice-cream-in-a-bag-602195). Recommandations say that rock salt would be the best salt to use for both making ice cream and defrosting your sidewalks. Other kinds of salts, [like calcium chloride](https://www.peterschemical.com/calcium-chloride-vs-rock-salt-which-do-you-use/), can be used to make better ice cream.

In essence, there are some cool science properties that can make good ice cream!

### What I’ve seen

<img src="/images/blog4-high_tea.jpg" width="400"> <img src="/images/blog4-oyakodon.jpg" width="400">

On the topic of food, the pictures above are two recipes that I’ve made over the past two weeks.

On the left is a [high tea setup](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-throw-afternoon-tea-party), inspired by a [High Cheese event](https://highteasociety.com/reviews/high-cheese-westin-melbourne-3/) that I attended a few years ago. It consisted of [an assortment of finger sandwiches](https://howtohightea.com/high-tea-sandwiches/), [a baked camembert](https://www.thepetitecook.com/how-to-make-baked-camembert/), [a brie and fig sandwich](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/brie-fig-and-apple-grilled-cheese/), [a homemade strawberry scone](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/scones-recipe/), tea, and hot chocolate. I also learned my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I definitely had leftovers!

On the right is a katsudon (combination of [oyakodon](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/128589/oyakodon-japanese-chicken-and-egg-rice-bowl/) and [chicken katsu](https://devour.asia/chicken-katsu-step-by-step/)) with miso soup, which I made during the chilly and rainy Memorial Day weekend.
