Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #16**! Welcome to the new year of 2022, where I’ve been… staying at home, social distancing and keeping warm. But I’ve made excuses to endure the chilly New York winter for some treats, such as doughnuts or [a peppermint mocha](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/), and then come home to a cute cozy cat.

### What I’ve been up to

Since I’ve visited my parents for Thanksgiving, I spent Christmas and New Years in NYC. Unfortunately, Monty the cat played around with the lights, so I decided not to set up a Christmas tree this year. However, there were some cool light setups from neighboring buildings, and I cooked up a hearty feast with some local products.

Due to the COVID-19 spike, some of my planned events were cancelled, so I opted for exploring local spots within Brooklyn instead. I try to support local restaurants and get some walking in by ordering takeout - and I have to walk fast before the food gets too cold! I’ve also binged some shows over the holidays (including [Game of Thrones](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones), `#waitingfornextbook`) and slowly trudged through [a game involving fantasy adventures kingdom management](https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/). The cat kept me company in the meanwhile, but he has been stalking me and giving me death stares right before dinnertime. *(Fat cat.)*

During the holidays, I needed to fix some of my electronics. My laptop of 5 years was bound to my apartment because the foldable screen no longer became foldable, but it was otherwise working fine. I finally got around to disconnecting and removing the top half of the laptop, then replacing the screen with an external computer monitor. It was also a good time to clean out the dust within the plastic frame and hardware.

I also accidentally dropped my cheap-ass phone on the subway, cracking the screen. I decided to try my hand on fixing my phone screen myself. I ordered the replacement parts and... well, I got the phone to work perfectly... with no sound. It turned out the sound chip was a thin chip embedded within the old case, and I couldn’t get the chip out without breaking it. *You live and you learn.* I decided to turn the downturn into a fun trip to my mobile carrier store to buy a not-so-cheap-ass phone, pick up some groceries from around the area, and grab a famous NYC bagel lox sandwich.

Lastly, I’ve planned some goals for 2022. I plan them by breaking them down into manageable sizes:
* Broader or bigger goals for the year. This can be "eat more healthily", "buy a house", or "learn how to dance".
* Smaller, more specific goals every month. They're based off of the yearly goals and can be "buy more vegetables in the grocery store", "deposit a total of $500 into my savings account", or "go to a Meetup with introductory dance lessons".
* At the start of every month, I write down some goals - a quarter of which I'm 99% sure I'll get done, one half of which I'm ~75% sure I'll get done, and a quarter of which I'm <35% sure I'll get done. At the end of the month, I see how much I've accomplished.

It rarely becomes a New Year's Resolution stint where the goals kinda fall away after January, but I do adapt if something unexpected requires me to shift my attention. Of course, getting a job will be one of those goals. :-)


### What I’ve learned

You guys know I really enjoy (mostly eating, but also cooking) food. In this new three-part series, I want to share about why we humans eat different kinds of food.

If you've been curious about any of these questions, then continue reading!
1. How much carbohydrates, fats, and protein should I eat daily?
2. Why are vitamins, minerals, water, and fiber important in my diet?
3. What exactly is metabolism?
4. What happens to the food and drink that I consume?
5. Why can I eat grapes and chocolate but my cat will die from eating them?

*Note:* This is [more general knowledge](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/) without context about your specific dietary needs or medical history. Obviously I'm not a dietitian or nutritionist, BUT I hope it gives you some insight about why we food. I couldn't include all the things I've learned about nutrition or the sources I've learned it from, but I try to include the good cuts.

#### Why do we food?

Obviously, we eat and drink to live! For some, food is just a means of survival, while other regard it very highly for quality and deliciousness (AKA the foodies). Most of us have a [comfort food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_food) that reminds us about a fond memory or a cultural heritage. Some have diets that revolve around their medical condition, and some may just eat whatever their heart desires.

All in all, we consume so that our bodies [have the energy to do work via calories](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-work). Then you get the terms "calories", "nutrition", "carbs", "fats", "sodium"... and now food and health have become complicated. But fear not - let's break down what exactly is in your food!

#### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates is the general term for starches and sugars. It's named this because all carbs have a chemical formula C<sub>X</sub> H<sub>2X</sub>O<sub>X</sub> (literally "carbon" + "hydrate/water"). Sugars are 1 or 2-unit molecules, while starches are linked chains of sugar. (This is why, after chewing on bread for a while, it may start to taste sweeter.) Carbs are used as your primary fuel source for the body, and should make up around half of your diet. Later in the series, you'll learn why starches are generally better for fuel than sugar, and [why diabetics consume sugar during a diabetic emergency](https://www.redcross.org.uk/first-aid/learn-first-aid/diabetic-emergency).

#### Fats

The technical term is lipids, which includes fats (solid) and oils (liquid). It similar in composition to a carbohydrate, but it doesn't have that nice chemical ratio, and there are far few O's in the formula. They're consumed because they act like long-term fuel storage for the body. If the body has low blood sugar, it's capable of breaking down fats into fuel. Also, any excess carbs in the diet is coverted into glycerol (a lipid) and stored in the liver and muscles, or into fat tissue. (Fun fact - if you're chemistry-savvy, you'll notice that [fats look chemically similar to fossil fuels](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/SDPS/SD.PS.LipPol.html)!) They're also important as building blocks for cells in your body.

Some fat in the diet is helpful - both for building and for taste.Generally though, it's better to stick to unsaturated fats over saturated fats. Cholesterol is naturally produced in the body, so it's better to minimize consumption of it. [Avoid trans fat at all costs.](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000786.htm) And of course, too much of a good thing like fat can lead to conditions such as artery plaque and high blood pressure.

#### Proteins

If carbs are the fuel for the body and fats are the fuel storage - proteins are the machines of the body. They're primarily responsible for actually breaking down food and building stuff in the body, which will be covered in detail later in the series. Protein can be consumed from both animals and plants (especially lentils and beans). Note that [you may be not need to have a lot of protein in your diet](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=how+much+protein+in+diet) unless you're actively building muscle. In fact, excess protein makes you pee more, making you dehydrated!

#### Vitamins and Minerals

Vitamins and minerals are the "micro molecules" of your diet. You don't need much of them to live a healthy life, and in fact [some can be toxic at high doses](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-overdose-on-vitamins#risks-of-high-doses). There are 13 different known vitamins and several different minerals that humans need. They're both consumed because they help with certain processes in your body, as opposed to directly affecting your body (i.e. carbs and fats as fuel, proteins as machines). Potassium and iron are two minerals lacking in many diets, while salt (sodium chloride) is one of the few minerals in American diets that [should be reduced due to hypertension risk](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456). The only difference between vitamins and minerals - [one is organic, and one is inorganic](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-chemistry-organic-carbon).

#### Fiber

[Fiber is a carbohydrate that we humans cannot digest.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/fiber/) (i.e. Why can't we eat grass like a cow can?) While our bodies can't convert fiber into fuel, [it is consumed to promote digestive health, regulate blood sugar, and encourage regularity](https://www.healthline.com/health/soluble-vs-insoluble-fiber#benefits). Eat your vegetables!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog16/blog16-lox.jpg" height="350"></div>

*Is a bagel lox sandwich a vegetable?*

#### Water

[Being hydrated is super important!](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/healthy_eating/water-and-healthier-drinks.html) Unlike food, a human will die if they don't drink water within a few *days*. It's used to make sweat in order to cool down your body. It makes up your blood and urine to keep things flowing through your body like a plumbing system and prevent disasters like kidney stones. Later in the series, you'll learn that water immensely helps with how cells work and metabolism. Just note that certain beverages, like alcohol, have counteractive effects and make you more dehydrated ([here's a link about alcohol from the Institute of Human Anatomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q1RH8A3O3c) - warning, there are cadavers in this video).

#### Conclusion

There's a lot of different kinds of foods and drinks out there! But with all the choices out there, they make up the fuel we need in our diets to stay healthy and alive. What you eat is what your body has to work with to maintain itself, but it doesn't necessarily mean eating a bland boring diet lacking *any* of the supposed bad foods such as fats and salt (medical condition notwithstanding).
