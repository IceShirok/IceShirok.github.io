Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #16**! Welcome to the new year of 2022, where I’ve been… staying at home, social distancing and keeping warm. But I’ve made excuses to endure the chilly New York winter for some treats, such as doughnuts or [a peppermint mocha](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/), and then come home to a cute cozy cat.

### What I’ve been up to

Since I’ve visited my parents for Thanksgiving, I spent Christmas and New Years in NYC. Unfortunately, Monty the cat played around with the lights, so I decided not to set up a Christmas tree this year. However, there were some cool light setups from neighboring buildings, and I cooked up a hearty feast with some local products.

Due to the COVID-19 spike, some of my planned events were cancelled, and I opted for exploring local spots within Brooklyn instead. I try to support local restaurants and get some walking in by ordering takeout - and I have to walk fast before the food gets too cold! I’ve also binged some shows over the holidays (including [Game of Thrones](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones), `#waitingfornextbook`) and slowly trudged through [a game involving fantasy adventures kingdom management](https://store.steampowered.com/app/640820/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__Enhanced_Plus_Edition/). The cat keeps me company in the meanwhile, but he does stalk me and give death stares right before dinnertime.

During the holidays, I needed to fix some of my electronics. My laptop of 5 years was bound to my apartment because the foldable screen no longer became foldable, but it was otherwise working fine. I finally got around to disconnecting and removing the top half of the laptop, then replacing the screen with an external computer monitor. It was also a good time to clean out the dust within the plastic frame and hardware.

I also accidentally dropped my cheap-ass phone on the subway, cracking the screen. I decided to try my hand on fixing my phone screen myself. I ordered a kit for the replacement parts and... well, I got the phone to work perfectly... with no sound. It turned out the sound chip was a thin chip embedded within the case, and I couldn’t get the chip out without breaking it. *Well you live and you learn.* I decided to turn the downturn into a fun trip to my mobile carrier store to buy a not-cheap-ass phone, pick up some groceries from around the area, and grab a famous NYC bagel lox sandwich.

Lastly, I’ve planned some goals for 2022. I plan them by breaking them down into manageable sizes:
* Broader or bigger goals for the year. This can be "eat more healthily", "buy a house", or "learn how to dance".
* Smaller, more specific goals every month. They're based off of the yearly goals and can be "buy more vegetables in the grocery store", "deposit a total of $500 into my savings account", or "go to a Meetup with introductory dance lessons".
* At the start of every month, I write down some goals - a quarter of which I'm 99% sure I'll get done, one half of which I'm ~75% sure I'll get done, and a quarter of which I'm <35% sure I'll get done.

Of course, getting a job will be one of those goals. :-)
