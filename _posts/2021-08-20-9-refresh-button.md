Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #9**, where I've returned from a trip to San Francisco for the first time! I've since been able to "press" my personal Refresh Button, feeling more relaxed (although still sleepy from jet lag) and rolling back into my NYC routine (if one can have a routine in a gap year).


### What I’ve been up to

I went on a family trip to San Francisco! Since it's been almost 2 years since my family had been together, those flying in were first-time SF visitors, and the COVID-19 cases have been increasing at the time - we spent our time together with a lot in our itinerary, and practicing social distancing. (Sorry SF peeps, but I will definitely visit the city again - there's a lot I still want to see!)

Here are some highlights from my trip to San Francisco!

*The Golden Gate Bridge with a model of the Bay's geological depths (top left).* A picture trying to combine my surprise at San Francisco's ["micro-climates"](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mr-chilly/id933759132), the iconic figure of the city, and my nerddom for models.

*A collection of Chinese tea in a tea shop in Chinatown (top right).* I learned to appreciate the subtleties of different teas while listening to a knowledgeable and humorous tea shop owner. I bought some [ginseng oolong tea leaves, known for its "energizing" properties](https://vitaltealeaf.net/products/ginseng-oolong). (Since I'm just shaking off the jet lag.)

*Redwood trees in Muir Woods (bottom left).* Did you know that the [redwood trees condensates San Francisco's fog to into water, which falls to its roots for watering](https://baynature.org/article/fog-and-redwoods-demystifying-the-mist/)? That's environmental adaptation right there! Not to mention how breathtaking the giant woods are.

*There wasn't information around, but I'm guessing this is an [unofficial breed of dahlia flower](https://www.almanac.com/plant/dahlias) outside the Conservatory of Flowers (bottom right).* The Golden Gate Park was beautiful but way too massive for my family to explore, so we honed in to the Conservatory of Flowers and the Japanese Tea Garden.

And for bonus points, I spent my resting time ~harassing~ attending to the cats at my stay.

With COVID-19 cases increasing again, I don't foresee planning longer trips like this for a while, especially with more holidays coming up. Also, it's nice to return to my own space in New York City, relax after a very busy vacation, and get back into a routine.


### What I’ve learned


### What I’ve seen

*Well, this is awkward.* I already have so many photos in the "What I’ve been up to" section. Since I was catching up on chores and obligations post-vacation, I also hadn't had much time to take different photos in the meanwhile.

Instead, I'll talk about my latest food obsession - [Greek salad](https://youtu.be/KmORWrgr_UE)!

Since I've been watching some videos on the Chinese language, YouTube decided that I was potentially interested in... learning Greek. I ended up spending a few hours getting sucked into Easy Greek and getting a crash course on the Greek language and culture (which should always include food!).

I coincidentally needed a new recipe to eat more vegetables, and this Greek salad was perfect. (I do omit the olives, since I don't their taste.) When I inevitably get bored with Greek salad, I can always use the ingredients for other dishes.
