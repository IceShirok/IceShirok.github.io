Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #21**! This month has been relatively uneventful to write a blog post on. That’s because I’ve been enjoying the outdoors and the summer weather, as well as resting at home with a good ol’ book or two.

# What I’ve been up to

Like the little blurb implies, I’ve not been doing much day-to-day that would be interesting to write in a blog post. BUT that doesn’t mean I haven’t been capturing some moments!

For example, Monty has been at my side while I work from home in the weekdays. This was him sitting right by my work laptop as he watches the windows on the opposite side of the room. (For obvious reasons, I’ve blotted out my work laptop screen and replaced it with an MS paint self portrait.)

Some mornings, I go grab a coffee and pastry to wake myself up for the morning. On busier nights, I order delivery because I can’t bother with cooking after a long work day. And on weekends, I inspire myself with some home cooking.

Below is my take on a miso ramen dish with a cold tofu side dish.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog21/blog21-ramen.jpg" width="350"></div>

- I’ve made the miso soup from scratch! I’ve followed [this recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-miso-soup/) as a guideline, but I’ve experimented with different ingredients based on the umami I preferred. So far, my favorite soup base was to soak kombu with a few anchovies. I then bring the broth to a boil, remove the ingredients, and add bonito flakes. I finally strain the solids, turn off the heat, and add miso paste.
- The chicken was made using a technique from a second cousin, who’s a professional chef. You sear the chicken in a cast iron skillet with oil for 3 minutes, put the skillet into the oven for 8 minutes, then sear the other side of the chicken for another 3 minutes. Unfortunately, I made or may not have set the smoke detector off because I added butter to the skillet. Whoops!
- The tofu side dish is a home recipe from my parents. It contains Chinese vinegar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds.

I’ve also made some spicy tuna and mayo onigiri (rice balls with filling). I couldn’t take a pretty picture of the onigiri, but it was delicious and filling. (My cat would agree from the smell!) On particularly busy weekdays, onigiri just became a spicy tuna rice bowl for lunch!

# What I’ve learned

Since my last blog post, I’ve finished reading *[Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow), a few years after wanting to buy the book and two years after receiving the book. The tl;dr is that human decision making does a good job of being overconfident and limited to a person’s model of the world. This blog post will give a broad summary of what I’ve learned, while I’ll post a Deep Lore blog in the near future!

It was generally a good read, but I would recommend reading it a few chapters at a time. Kahneman provided simple examples to demonstrate each topic (and even mentioned why he provides examples in each chapter). The book covers various industries that fall under the trap of decision making errors such as economics, medicine, the Western legal system, the Israeli military, and marketing.

I did come into this book having previously known about general psychology, probability and statistics, game theory, and public health. These topics all helped put a name to concepts Kahneman addressed in his book. Examples included the [Stanford Marshmallow Test](https://bingschool.stanford.edu/news/bing-marshmallow-studies-50-years-continuing-research), the [bystander effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bystander-effect), [fundamental attribution error](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/the-fundamental-attribution-error), [Bayes’ theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem), and the [problem with nationwide HIV testing](https://dlsun.github.io/probability/bayes.html). There were other examples that I’ve learned through personal experience, and other examples that I’ve had no experience (like the nuances of stock trading). Fear not - the book read easily enough for a layman to read through.

## The Two Systems

Kahneman defines the “two systems” of decision making within a human being.

**System 1** is the half that is always listening, assessing, and judging. It pattern matches and steoreotypes. Examples include identifying a spider, assessing the distance of a stop sign, and deciding whether to buy that extra fries when you’re hungry.

It is the intuitive system that helps us humans survive, but also can hinder us with bad judgments. It lets you make decisions quickly, usually by answering a question with an easier question (or a heuristics). System 1 gives you a decision that usually makes you feel confident because it’s easy and familiar (or System 1 alters a hard question to seem so).

System 1 is shaped by a person’s individual experience (conscious or subconscious) formed into a person’s model of the world, and it helps guide a person through unfamiliar situations.

**System 2** is the half that performs complex calculations and other assessments if System 1 can’t figure out the problem. Examples include hard mathematical equations, figuring out sums, and actively learning.

It is a lazy system - it only does work when prompted, and has a limited battery life before System 1 takes over. (This is why sometimes you make really bad decisions after being mentally exhausted from reading a white paper or doing some other taxing task.) It lays the options on the table, which can cause an analysis paralysis and genreally lower your confidence in making a decision.

It’s important to note that **both systems have their advantages and disadvantages**. System 1 is used to make quick decisions to easy problems, although what is considered “easy” can be misattributed. System 2 is used to analyze situations to hard problems, but it’s mentally draining and must be trained to perform complex analysis.

The best examples that Kahneman describes in detail is [the hierarchy of competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) and the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). A beginner could feel overconfident in their limited skill because they don’t know how much they actually don’t know. An intermediate recognizes their limited scope of knowledge and spends great effort to learn and practice. An expert can quickly perform a skill because they can pattern match from experience. (In the Deep Lore post, I’ll talk about how certain industries could have “fake experts”!)

## Statistics is Hard

Hear me out when I say that I’ve taken a college-level probability and statistics course, and many other classes that relied of statistical analysis. I can with confidence that **probability and statistics are wholly unintuitive**. Here’s an example:

*I toss a coin 99 times and all coin tosses (which is tossed by a fair coin) have landed on heads. What is the chance that the next coin toss lands on a head?*

**The answer is 50%**, because the 100th coin toss is independent of the previous 99 coin tosses (which had already happened), and I didn’t ask “what is the chance of 100 coin tosses of a fair coin to all land heads?” (This is why I don’t gamble.)

Prob/stat is so unintuitive to humans because:

- Humans are hardwired with System 1 in order to survive. It’s a fast, intuitive system in the midst of independent situations.
- Statistics require quite a lot of domain knowledge. For example, how can you know what is the probability of dying from COVID-19 without knowing the population to analyze, the particular area that you’re observing, the COVID-19 viral strain, etc. Just wear your mask and wash your hands. System 2 has to be trained in statistical analysis in order to be able to make decisions that require statistical analysis.
- Kahneman emphasized how well humans make up stories for a series of events that we confuse as causation. In reality, most things in life is random, or the environment is so complex that we consider it random.

Statistics don’t lie, right? Human society would be much better and utopian if we just shoved a graph with lines connecting the dots and some percentages, right? **WRONG.**

Here is a simple example from Kahneman:

*If you were a doctor and was going to treat someone with a disease, which of the treatments would you choose?*

*A. Treatment has a 90% chance of recovery.*

*B. Treatment has a 10% mortality rate.*

While both treatments are the same logically, Treatment A would be more favorable because of its positive messaging! Many, many chapters drill into this concept of framing.

Kahneman states that the word “rational” is quite complex. While most people think of “rational” as one who frequently engages in System 2 and knows better than to make decisions through impulse and emotions. However, is a person considered rational if they make decisions that align with their model of the world, even if that model is limited? According to Kahneman, yes. (Which is why two people can vastly disagree in opinions because they’ve been raised and influenced by different experiences, even if they view the same situation.)

This concept of framing is quite amazing but should be used carefully.

- On one side, framing can be detrimentally manipulative. Advertising influences potential customers through sneaky messaging. Politicians prepare speeches that boosts their own credentials while downsizing their opponents.
- On the other side, framing can be manipulative, if not to nudge people in the right direction. In reality, most people in any society aren’t studied to recognize and apply good policies. In addition, American society values freedom and loathes authoritarian policies - no one wants to be told what to do. BUT with some crafty framing, people can be nudged into the right direction.

## That’s a wrap

Kahneman’s *Thinking Fast and Slow* is a good read, and will give you a good think about how you and others make decisions with two different systems. It’s why objectively showing the data to others doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you win an argument. It’s why people will choose sure gains and gamble on losses, and not gamble gains or choose sure losses. It provides a glimpse into the conflicts, and perhaps harmony, between human intuition and human intelligence. I think it’s a great read, whether you’ll use the knowledge for your professional or personal life.

# What I’ve seen

Surprise, surprise, it’s more food. Below is some Korean BBQ with the obligatory side dishes. (I was the first one from my party so I could grab a table before they were all taken!)

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog21/blog21-kbbq.jpg" width="350"></div>

Below is some dessert (a chocolate cake with matcha and chocolate gooey filling with matcha ice cream) and a peppermint tea to balance the sweetness. If you ever visit New York City, I cannot stress enough to check out the [Spot Dessert Bar](https://www.spotdessertbar.com/)! There are locations in K-Town, St Mark’s Place, and Flushing, Queens.
