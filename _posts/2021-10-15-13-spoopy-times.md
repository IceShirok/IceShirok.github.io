Hi folks, welcome to *War(un)lock blog #13*! It’s October - that means cooler weather (finally), [spoopy decorations](https://tenor.com/view/spoopy-spooky-halloween-gif-14092772) (is the spelling still a thing?), and [pumpkin spice on everything](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/052484). With a recently-adopted cat in the home now, I’ve spent most of my time learning about being a cat owner, and what it means to have a cat as the boss in the house.

### What I’ve been up to

Since the publishing of this blog, it will be 3 weeks since Monty lived under my household. All room and board are paid for - including food, water, litter, toys, and bedding. That being said, Monty prefers some bedding more than others.

I’ll be hanging around locally in NYC for at least a couple of weeks as I get to know more about Monty’s personality and how my schedule fits into cat ownership. Some things I’ve learned so far:
* Monty has been my alarm clock for ~7 am much more reliably than my alarm clock. He’s learned how to respectfully tread next to me and meow for breakfast. He’s learned to at least wait until I wash up in the bathroom.
* Monty learned how to jump to my desk and get my attention… by sitting right between me and my computer. It is a good reminder for me to take a break.
* I’ve talked to Monty a LOT more than I expected. I mostly use the phrases “[boy](https://youtu.be/Pobwy_es2uc)” and “buddy”, and jokingly “boss” to others.
* If you haven’t seen, Monty [LOVES egg cartons for some reason](http://foodpuzzlesforcats.com/diy-egg-carton-can-food-puzzle). It took a while to figure out which toys he liked because he was slow to warm up to all other toys. He has warmed up to the laser pointer now, and also loves chasing the occasional house fly.
* Monty gets a lot of love. I was told that his previous owner gave him to foster care after moving out of New York (which is… okay why bro). Now he gets to put up with my shenanigans, but also is welcome to sit on my lap.

I’ve spent my time exploring NYC in the meanwhile. I’ve browsed through various pet stores around the area, and have occasionally discovered an outdoor market event, or visited another store that was on my to-do list for some time. I’m preparing Christmas gifts a bit early to compensate for overloaded postal services. I’ve reconnected with peeps on LinkedIn, and [made some new connections along the way](https://wednesdaybagels.substack.com/)!

### What I’ve learned

After several weeks of learning about electricity, it’s finally time to talk about circuits!

Electrical energy itself is not useful, but it’s instead a form of energy that can be easily transported through wires. Energy can be transformed into electrical energy, where it’s rapidly carried and distributed to its destination; the energy can then be transformed to other forms of energy to do useful work.

The most important things to note:
* *[Energy is conserved.](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Law_of_conservation_of_energy)* The energy can be transformed into another form, but cannot simply be created or destroyed.
* *[Charge is conserved.](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Law_of_conservation_of_charge)* Remember those charged particles from two blog posts ago? The same amount of charged particles, and thus the sum of charges, is constant. The charges may be distributed unevenly.

The simplest circuit is - well - a simple circuit. It consists of a voltage source and a resistor. The voltage source produces the energy needed to generate a current. (Batteries generate electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction.) As a current passes through a resistor, an amount of energy is taken from the resistor and thus there is a “voltage drop”. Everything in the circuit should use up the energy before the circuit returns to the battery terminal.

<div style="text-align:center">*A diagram of a simple circuit with the voltage shown. Note that the voltage is higher before reaching the resistor, and lower after reaching the resistor. The battery generates the energy to create the higher voltage.*</div>

[Recall that Ohm’s Law is I=V/R.](https://www.fluke.com/en-us/learn/blog/electrical/what-is-ohms-law) It is a mathematical formula that describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance.

What happens in more complex circuits, like multiple resistors in a circuit? Well, [it depends how the resistors are arranged.](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_II_-_Thermodynamics_Electricity_and_Magnetism_(OpenStax)/10%3A_Direct-Current_Circuits/10.03%3A_Resistors_in_Series_and_Parallel)

If the resistors are arranged in a series, then the current loses (via heat or some form of work) a bit of energy for every resistor it passes through. Since charges are preserved, the current’s value remains constant. Thus, resistors in series are equivalent to one powerful resistor.

<div style="text-align:center">*A diagram of a circuit with resistors in series. As the current passes through each resistor, there is a voltage drop, but the current remains constant.*</div>

If the resistors are arranged in parallel, things get interesting. Since the wires split to accommodate each resistor, like a river fork, the current splits into smaller values. The current value depends on the resistor strength; a resistor with little resistance will have a larger current flow through, while a resistor with higher resistor will have a smaller current. According to Ohm’s Law, this inverse relationship implies a constant voltage. This is because resistors in parallel [have equipotential](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/equipot.html). (This is harder to summarize in the blog post.) Because of maths, resistors in parallel are weaker in summation than any individual resistor in the group.

Circuits can get complicated quickly, but the conservation of energy and charge help provide rules to trace how much current and voltage is used in any given circuit component. [This is known as Kirchhoff’s Law as part of circuit analysis.](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/dccircuits/dcp_4.html) (Because it also involves solving for multiple unknown variables, I won’t go through proving that this works mathematically.)

Fun fact: [Rechargeable batteries are rechargeable](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/battery5.htm) because electric energy is used to reverse the (non-spontaneous) chemical reaction in the battery. Once the battery is placed in a circuit for discharging, the electrochemical reaction spontaneously occurs, resulting in a current in the circuit!
