Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #8** as we enter into the month of August. Life loves to throw in the spice of surprise, with the Olympics ongoing amidst the surge of COVID-19 cases and the news media abuzz.


### What I’ve been up to

I've spent the rest of July wrapping up loose ends such as online courses, volunteering sessions, and video gaming. My brain did get into Vacation Mode early, so I ended my Practice Mode earlier than expected.

*Why Vacation Mode?* I've traveled to Indianapolis to visit a college friend and to explore the Midwest for vacation!

*The White River Canal Walk in Downtown Indy.*

It has been refreshing to explore an entirely different city, in contrast to the NYC neighborhood that I now have memorized every bodega and sidewalk crack. I've explored museums and parks, ate lots of good locally-sourced food, visited local breweries, kayaked on a lake, and rode a bike through the bike-friendly paths to burn all the calories.

#### Brief blurb on transportation

I've found exploring Indy to be simultaneously stimulating and unnerving - stimulating because it's fun to find cool new spots, and unnerving because I'll inevitably annoy the locals! After a personal tour from my friend, I spent my solo time walking, biking, and riding the bus around the city.

**Walking** with my own two feet is always the most fun when it comes to exploring new small shops or restaurants, or spotting charming details that I would otherwise pass over if I traveled at a faster speed. However, this method of transportation ends early when my feet and back start to ache.

**Biking** has been super easy in Indianapolis, due to its utter lack of hills and well-maintained paths. It has been fun to get a preview of places I wanted to explore on foot, while also burning calories to eat more food!

**Taking the bus** was a viable option in Indy, since most of the farther places I wanted to visit were accessible by bus. I definitely had a few bumps navigating the payment system and routes, but appreciated the system as a cheap and efficient way to move to various parts of the city. Of course, everyone on the bus had to wear masks.

Finally, **riding a car or plane** was the fastest, most expensive, and dullest mode of transportation in my time in Indy. It was mostly due to my desire to get to a destination over enjoying the scenic journey, or fretting over whether I'd get lost.


### What I’ve learned

What do bike brakes, IV drips, and fire hoses have in common? Fluid mechanics! Yes, I've been still thinking about how cool fluid mechanics are, even after shelving my scuba diving certification for the time being. Its applications surrounds us - literally, like pipes!

#### Background

Before going into fluid mechanics, a bit of background is needed:

Pressure is the amount of force exerted over a given cross-sectional area. The exact formula is `P = F/A`. This is why, for example, a syringe's tiny needle can pierce skin with a relatively soft jab. *Did you know?* Flight attendants in the early days of commercial flight couldn't wear high heels because their weight would cause the heels to pierce through the airplane floor from the immense pressure!

Pressure can also be expressed relative to the depth of an object in a fluid, or the relative height of a fluid. (`P = hpg`, and the Interwebs has articles on how to derive this.) *Did you know?* IV bags are hung higher so that the fluid's pressure is higher than the pressure in a patient's vein, so the fluid flows into the patient.

#### Pascal's Principle

One of the coolest things I've learned about fluid mechanics is [Pascal's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_law). In short, if a fluid is contained in a closed container, a pressure change in the container is transmitted throughout the fluid without any loss. Why is this so important to know?

**Fluid pressure distributes evenly.** That means the pressure change can occur at one end, and cause pressure change throughout a potentially long container. Bike brakes, for example, can use a hydraulic system to brake a wheel by squeezing the lever on the handlebar.

Since fluid pressure distributes evenly, the **force adjusts accordingly based on the cross-sectional area.** If a small force is exerted on one end with a small cross-sectional area, the other end with a larger cross-sectional area will exert a larger force. The [hydraulic press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press) is a great demonstration of Pascal's Principle in action.

Note that Pascal's Principle doesn't apply to a fire hose once the water is let loose - since the fire hose is no longer a closed container!

#### Other tidbits

An interesting thing I've found about fluid mechanics is [its analogy with the study of electric circuits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy). While I have learned about electricity several times over (mostly for college applications), I can never remember the difference between amps, volts, and ohms. While I couldn't find the original animation/video on the analogy, [this live demo](https://youtu.be/Z_s3TmYQAuc) demonstrates parallels between electrical circuits (flow of electrons) and fluid mechanics (flow of fluid). While electricity (from my experience) is mostly studied through diagrams and more abstract thinking, the water demos show a much more concrete demonstration.


### What I’ve seen

This was a meta and somewhat ironic image that I came across while visiting the Indiana State Museum. The museum had a section dedicated to the opiod crisis in Indiana (and can extend to the U.S.). The section included interactive activities around neurology, mental health, addiction, and stigma. Some posters also touch upon social media and marketing as an addiction in itself.

While this blog is meant to keep in some of the ugly and unpolished bits of the gap year, I have to think about what to keep in and what to omit in order to provide a coherent and interesting blog post. And (very much appreciated) readers have chatted to me about topics they're interested in and have come across the blog. It's been fun engaging in those conversations, since we learn more about the topic and each other!
