Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #8** as we enter into the month of August. Life loves to throw in the spice of surprise, with the Olympics ongoing amidst the surge of COVID-19 cases and the news media abuzz.

### What I’ve been up to

I've spent the rest of July wrapping up loose ends such as online courses, volunteering sessions, and video gaming. My brain did get into Vacation Mode early, so I did end my Practice Mode early.

Why Vacation Mode? I've traveled to Indianapolis to visit a college friend and to explore the Midwest for vacation!

It has been refreshing to explore an entirely different city, in contrast to the NYC neighborhood that I now know off the back of my head. Activities included exploring museums and parks, eating lots good food, visiting the breweries, kayaking on a peaceful lake, and riding a bike through the bike-friendly paths to burn the calories.

#### Brief blurb on transportation

I've found exploring a new city to be simultaneously stimulating and unnerving - stimulating because it's fun to find cool new spots, and unnerving because I'll inevitably annoy the locals! After a personal tour from my friend, I spent my solo time walking, biking, and riding the bus around the city.
* Walking with my own two feet is always the most fun when it comes to exploring new small shops or restaurants, or spotting eccentric details that I would otherwise pass over if I went at a different speed. However, this method of transportation ends early when my feet and back start to ache.
* Biking has been super easy in Indianapolis, due to its utter lack of hills and well-maintained paths. It has been fun to get a preview of places I wanted to explore on foot, while also burning calories to eat more food!
* Since most of the further places were accessible by bus, I decided to try out the bus system. I definitely had a few bumps navigating the bus system, but definitely appreciated the system as a tourist. While it's slower and initially confusing to navigate, it is a cheap and efficient way to move to various parts of the city. It also helped me appreciate the existence of subways, which are fast and efficient.

### What I’ve learned

What do bike brakes, IV drips, and fire hoses have in common? Fluid mechanics! Yes, I've been still thinking about how cool fluid mechanics are, even after shelving my scuba diving certification for the time being. It is permeated in our everyday lives, and surrounds us - literally, such as pipes!

For a tiny bit of background:
* Pressure is the amount of force exerted over a given cross-sectional area. The exact formula is `P = F/A`. This is why, for example, a syringe's tiny needle can pierce skin with a relatively soft jab. Also, flight attendants in the early days of commercial flight couldn't wear high heels because their weight would cause the heels to pierce through the airplane floor from the immense pressure!
* Pressure can also be expressed relative to the depth of an object in a fluid, or the relative height of a fluid. (`P = hpg`, and the Interwebs has articles on how to derive this.) IV bags are hung higher so that the fluid's pressure is higher than the pressure in a patient's vein, so the fluid flows into the patient.

One of the coolest things I've learned about fluid mechanics is [Pascal's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_law). In short, if a fluid is contained in a closed container, a pressure change in the container is transmitted throughout the fluid without any loss.

Why is this so important to know?
* Fluid pressure distributes evenly. That means the pressure change can occur at one end, and cause pressure change throughout a potentially long container. Bike brakes, for example, can use a hydraulic system to brake a wheel by squeezing the lever on the handlebar.
* Since fluid pressure distributes evenly, the force and cross-sectional area should adjust accordingly. If a small force is exerted on one end with a small cross-sectional area, the other end with a larger cross-sectional area will exert a larger force. The [hydraulic press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press) is a great demonstration of Pascal's Principle in action.

An interesting thing about hydraulics is [its analogy with the study of electric circuits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy). While I have learned about electricity several times, I can never remember the difference between amps, volts, and ohms. While I couldn't find the original animation/video on the analogy, [this live demo](https://youtu.be/Z_s3TmYQAuc) demonstrates parallels between electrical circuits and fluid flow. While electricity is mostly studied through diagrams and more abstract thinking, the water demos show a much more concrete demonstration.

### What I’ve seen

This was a meta and somewhat ironic image that I came across while visiting the Indiana State Museum. The museum had a section dedicated to the opiod crisis in Indiana (and can extend to the U.S.). The section included interactive activities around neurology, mental health, addiction, and stigma. Some posters also touch upon social media and marketing as an addiction in itself.

While this blog is meant to keep in some of the ugly bits of the gap year, I have to think about what to keep in and what to omit in order to provide a coherent and interesting blog post. And (very much appreciated) readers have chatted to me about topics they're interested in and have come across the blog. It's been fun engaging in those conversations, since we learn more about the topic and each other!
