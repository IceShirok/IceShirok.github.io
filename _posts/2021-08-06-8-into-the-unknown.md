Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #8** as we enter into the month of August. Life loves to throw in the spice of surprise, with the Olympics ongoing amidst the surge of COVID-19 cases and the news media abuzz as always.

### What I’ve been up to

I've spent the rest of July wrapping up loose ends such as online courses, volunteering sessions, and video gaming. My brain did get into Vacation Mode early, so I did drop some of my Practice Mode early so I could start my vacation early.

Finally, I've traveled to Indianapolis to visit a college friend and to explore the Midwest!

I've found exploring a new city to be simultaneously stimulating and unnerving - stimulating because it's fun to find cool new spots, and unnerving because I'll inevitably annoy the locals! After a personal tour from my friend, I spent my solo time walking, biking, and riding the bus around the city.
* Walking with my own two feet is always the most fun when it comes to exploring new small shops or restaurants, or spotting eccentric details that I would otherwise pass over if I went at a different speed. However, this method of transportation ends early when my feet and back start to ache.
* Biking has been super easy in Indianapolis, due to its utter lack of hills and well-maintained paths. It has been fun to get a preview of places I wanted to explore on foot, while also burning calories to eat more food!
* Since most of the further places were accessible by bus, I decided to try out the bus system. I definitely had a few bumps navigating the bus system, but definitely appreciated the system as a tourist. While it's slower and initially confusing to navigate, it is a cheap and efficient way to move to various parts of the city. It also helped me appreciate the existence of subways, which are fast and efficient.

### What I’ve learned

This bit of learning will go more metacognitive~

This was a meta and somewhat ironic image that I came across while visiting the Indiana State Museum. The museum had a section dedicated to the opiod crisis in Indiana, which can extend to the U.S. It also touches upon social media, and the implication that it has become an addiction in itself.

While this blog was meant to keep in some of the ugly bits of the gap year, I had to think about what to keep in and what to omit in order to provide a coherent and interesting blog post. And (very much appreciated) readers have chatted to me about common topics that we're interested in.

[Confirmation bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) is extraordinarily powerful and dangerous. People can view the exact same situation in completely different lights because of their different experiences and viewpoints.

As a bonus: there is a neat website on [6 strategies for effective learning](https://www.learningscientists.org/downloadable-materials). The ones I am particularly bad at keeping up are Retrieval Practice and Elaboration, partially because I don't have the time to continuously regurgitate information in front of me. I do have the habit of synthesizing information into a summary, losing details in favor of taking key points.

### What I’ve seen

I've traveled to Indianapolis to visit a college friend and to explore the Midwest! It has been refreshing to explore an entirely different city, in contrast to the NYC neighborhood that I now know off the back of my head. Activities included exploring museums and parks, eating lots good food, visiting the breweries, kayaking on a peaceful lake, and riding a bike through the bike-friendly paths to burn the calories.
