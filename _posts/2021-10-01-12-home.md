Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #12**! I’ve been swept up with an unusual amount of shenanigans to do at home.


### What I’ve been up to

***CAT!***

It’s been a month-long active process to adopt this buddy - searching for a foster care, visiting cats virtually and in-person, asking many questions, and driving out to New Jersey to pickup the cat. I’m happy to report that he was mostly well-behaved from Day 1, and I didn’t get any tickets while I had the car in my possession in NYC! As I write this blog, he’s sleeping soundly on the other side of the sofa with arms outstretched.

I've been thinking about getting a cat for some time, but it wasn't until early last year that I moved into an apartment that 1) allowed cats, and 2) didn't have ridiculous pet fees and policies. Last month, I saw NBC News advertise [Clear the Shelters](https://www.cleartheshelters.com), which was an fortunate opportunity to view different foster cares. After a massive amount of procrastination, I made the leap to go through the cat adoption process. It took a few weeks of preparing the apartment for a cat, making some phone and Zoom calls, and doing a lot of research.

The timing of the adoption, however, was unfortunate. On top of getting a car, coordinating cat pickup, and figuring out how to drive in the NYC streets - I had a scheduled CKAD exam, an impromptu doctor’s appointment, and online course deadlines. It’s the busiest I’ve been in the gap year, which was stressful but oddly welcoming to have. Just a lot of time management, good communication, and more dinner takeouts.

I’m happy to report that things lined up super well!
* I renewed my CKAD certification! I felt much better going into the exam the second go-round, if only because I knew the material better, and the cat home preparation took up a lot more of my attention. (BTW, I [updated my CKAD exam blog if you want to become CKAD certified yourself!](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/))
* Prior to picking up the cat from his foster parents, I took the opportunity to visit parts of New Jersey that would not be possible without a car. It mostly consisted of Asian food.
* The cat pickup was super smooth, and I got tons of tips from the sweetest foster parents.
* Fortunately, there was nothing serious that came out of my telemedicine appointment. I only needed a two-week prescription.
* I spent the next few days taking a break from my daily routine to catch up on video games, relax at home, and enjoy loving a new furry friend.

But not everything was rainbows and sunshine the past few weeks.
* Unfortunately, in my endeavor to cat-proof the apartment, the rest of my herb seedlings didn’t make it. I think the seedlings are [much more sensitive to the tap water than I thought](https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/10-facts-you-may-not-know-about-new-york-citys-drinking-water/).
* I also was so focused on my schedule, I forgot to buy some mooncakes for [the Autumn Harvest Festival that occurred last Tuesday](https://www.chinahighlights.com/festivals/mid-autumn-festival-date.htm). Whoops. But I can try to find some mooncakes on sale now!

But all the upfront expenses and added stress were all worth it. Things went to plan without a hitch, and I have a new fuzzy friend!


### What I’ve learned

Last week, I talked about the basis of electricity - charges and the forces that attract or repel them. Now it’s all about circuits!

I mentioned before that electricity and circuits were a weakness of mine for some time. In college, I only learned computers down to logical gates and motherboard component functions, but nothing about semiconductors or the physics behind how electronics worked. And you know, after spending a few weeks learning more about electricity, I remember why.

#### Voltage

You need energy to do work - and I mean this in terms of physics. A tennis ball cannot move without some force to nudge it, i.e. a push. A tennis ball cannot fall through the air without a way for it to be lifted into the air, i.e. a hand picking it up.

Voltage is a measurement of high electrical potential energy to low electrical potential energy. In a circuit, the battery provides energy (via a chemical reaction that generates electrical energy) to be able to do work. As the energy passes through the wire and components, a certain amount of energy is used up, and the voltage drops in each component.

#### Current

Current is the flow of positive charges in a wire per unit time. (In actuality, it’s usually the flow of electrons or negatively-charged particles that causes current. However, the convention stuck.) Without a voltage, these charges don’t have the energy to move as current!

#### Resistance

There’s resistance, which is where energy is lost in the circuit. Some of the energy is used to do useful work, like to generate the light in a lightbulb or generate a magnetic force. But lots of that energy also turns into heat, which could be intended or not. In reality, everything in a circuit has some resistance, including batteries and even the wire.

#### Circuits

A simple circuit consists of a voltage source and a resistor.


### What I’ve seen

This week, and probably in the next few blog posts, will be cat pics. Sorry, not sorry.
