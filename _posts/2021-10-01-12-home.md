Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #12**! I’ve been swept up with an unusual amount of shenanigans to do locally, both planned and unplanned. Fortunately, I made it through the chaos with a bit of planning and temporarily cutting some slack on other parts of my life. (I can't write too much without spoiling the rest of the blog post!)


### What I’ve been up to

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/blog12/blog12-cat1.JPG" height="350"></div>

***CAT!***

It’s been a month-long active process to adopt this buddy - searching for a foster care, visiting cats virtually and in-person, asking many different questions, and driving out to New Jersey to pickup the cat. I’m happy to report that he was mostly well-behaved from Day 1, and I didn’t get any tickets while I had the car in my possession in NYC! As I write this blog, he’s soundly napping on the other side of the sofa.

I've been thinking about getting a cat for some time, but it wasn't until early last year that I moved into an apartment that 1) allowed cats, and 2) didn't have ridiculous pet fees and policies. Then the pandemic happened, where pet adoptions were at an all-time high and the adoption process was rocked by social distancing. ...then I started the gap year and prioritized exploration and travel. After a massive amount of procrastination, I came across an NBC News advertisement called [Clear the Shelters](https://www.cleartheshelters.com), which promoted pet adoptions in already-crowded animal shelters. I finally made the leap to go research on foster cares and start the cat adoption process. It took a few weeks of preparing the apartment for a cat, doing a lot of research, and making phone and Zoom calls. The longer the processs took, the more excited I was to adopt a cat.

The exact timing of the adoption, however, was unfortunate. I was preparing to get a car, coordinate cat pickup with the foster parents, and figured out how to drive in the NYC streets. I also had a scheduled CKAD exam (which needed to be completed before Sept 28), an impromptu doctor’s appointment (because life happens), and online course deadlines (because I procrastinate). It’s the busiest I’ve been in the gap year, which was stressful but oddly welcoming. It took a lot of time management, good communication, and more dinner takeouts for a few weeks.

I’m happy to report that out of everything that happened the past two weeks, things went smoothly!
* *I renewed my CKAD certification!* I felt much better going into the exam the second go-round, if only because I knew the material better, and the cat home preparation took up a lot more of my attention. (BTW, I [updated my CKAD exam blog if you want to become CKAD certified yourself!](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/))
* *I finally visited New Jersey!* Prior to picking up the cat from his foster parents, I took the opportunity to visit parts of New Jersey that would not be possible without a car. It mostly consisted of Asian food.
* *I brought a new cat into his new home!* The cat pickup was super smooth, and I got tons of tips from the sweetest foster parents.
* *I'm healthy!* Nothing serious that came out of my telemedicine appointment!
* *I had time to decompress after ssome major events passed.* I spent the next few days taking a break from my daily routine to catch up on video games, relax at home, and enjoy loving a new furry friend.

While I'd like to like things generally positive, not everything was rainbows and sunshine the past few weeks.
* Unfortunately, in my endeavor to cat-proof the apartment, the rest of my herb seedlings didn’t make it. I think the seedlings are [much more sensitive to the tap water than I thought](https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/10-facts-you-may-not-know-about-new-york-citys-drinking-water/).
* I also was so focused on my schedule, I forgot to buy some mooncakes for [the Autumn Harvest Festival that occurred last Tuesday](https://www.chinahighlights.com/festivals/mid-autumn-festival-date.htm). *Whoops.* But I can try to find some mooncakes on sale now!

All the upfront expenses and added stress were all worth a new fuzzy friend (oh, and a renewed certification too)!


### What I’ve learned

Last blog post, [I talked about the basis of electricity](https://www.warunlock.com/11-inflight/) - charges and the forces that attract or repel them. Now it’s all about circuits!

I mentioned before that electricity and circuits were a weakness of mine for some time. In college, I only learned computers down to [logic gates](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/logic_gates.htm) and [motherboard components](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started/2), but nothing about [semiconductors or the physics behind how electronics worked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor). After spending a few weeks learning more about electricity, I remember why it was a struggle again - lots of unknown terminology and paradigms. This time, I think I got a better grasp!

#### Voltage

[You need energy to do work - and I mean this in terms of physics.](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-work) A tennis ball cannot move without some force to nudge it, i.e. a push. A tennis ball cannot fall through the air without a way for it to be lifted into the air, i.e. a hand picking it up. In some way, energy is transferred to the tennis ball so it can move. In a similar way, [voltage is a measurement of energy per unit charge](https://definedelectric.com/basic-definitions-voltage/). That is to say, how much energy is available to move a charged particle around? 12V car batteries need a lot of energy to start the car, while a 1.5V battery is safe to use in handheld devices.

In a circuit, the battery provides that energy via a chemical reaction that generates electrical energy. This energy allows charged particles to flow through the wires in the circuit. As the energy passes through circuit components (i.e. a lightbulb), a certain amount of energy is used up.

#### Current

Current is the flow of positive charges in a wire per unit time. (In actuality, it’s usually the flow of electrons or negatively-charged particles that causes current. [However, the convention stuck.](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circuits/Lesson-2/Electric-Current)) Without a voltage, these charges don’t have the energy to move as current!

A current allows charged particles to move through a conductor, like a wire. The energy from the charged particles can be transferred to something else, or transformed into other forms of energy. An incadescent lightbulb transforms electrical energy into light and heat as a current passes through the wire filament. By contrast, [a fluorescent lightbulb uses electrical energy to excite the gas inside](https://www.atlantalightbulbs.com/how-does-fluorescent-light-work/), which emits light.

#### Resistance

There’s resistance, which is where energy is "lost" in the circuit. Resistors are commonplace in circuits. Some examples:
* Appliances have a certain amount of voltage (read: energy per charge) to work optimally, but may not be compatible with the voltage supplied by the power outlet in your wall (110V in the U.S.). Resistors help reduce the voltage to a compatible value. That's also why you bring a power adaptor when travelling internationally - [not all power outlets have the same voltages that an appliance can adapt to](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/).
* Resistors help to prevent hazards like [short-circuiting](https://romanelectrichome.com/ways-to-prevent-short-circuits/), where there is too little resistance and too much electrical current flowing in a circuit. This scenario causes a lot of energy buildup in a circuit, and can cause fires or appliance damage.
* In reality, everything in a circuit has resistance - components, the battery, and even the wire!

#### Circuits

A simple circuit consists of a voltage source and a resistor.

#### Extra tidbits

If you're still confused about electricity - then I don't blame you! You can find plenty of analogies, such as [an analogy with water pipes and fluid dynamics](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/all).


### What I’ve seen

This week, and probably in the next few blog posts, will be cat pics. Sorry, not sorry.
