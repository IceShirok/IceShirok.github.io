Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #12**! I’ve been swept up with an unusual amount of shenanigans to do at home.


### What I’ve been up to

To clear up the elephant in the room, may I instead show in my room...

CAT!

It’s been a month-long active process to get his buddy - from searching for a foster care to adopt, to driving out to NJ for pickup. I’m happy to report that he was mostly well-behaved from Day 1, and I didn’t get any tickets while I had the car in my possession! As I write this blog, he’s sleeping soundly on the other side of the sofa.

It was an opportune timing that I saw NBC News advertise [Clear the Shelters](https://www.cleartheshelters.com). After a massive amount of procrastination, I made the leap to finally adopt a cat. It took a few weeks of preparing the apartment for a cat, making some phone and Zoom calls, and doing a lot of research.

The adoption timing was somewhat unfortunate. It lined up with my scheduled CKAD exam date, an impromptu doctor’s appointment, hospital regulation shenanigans, and online course deadlines. It’s the busiest I’ve been in the gap year, which was stressful but oddly welcoming to have. Just a lot of time management, good communication, and more dinner takeouts.

I’m happy to report that things lined up super well!
* I renewed my CKAD certification! I felt much better going into the exam the second go-round, if only because I knew the material better, and the cat home preparation took up a lot more of my attention. (BTW, I [updated my CKAD exam blog if you want to become CKAD certified yourself!](https://www.warunlock.com/11-extra-ckad-prep/))
* Prior to picking up the cat from his foster parents, I took the opportunity to visit parts of New Jersey that would not be possible without a car. It mostly consisted of Asian food.
* Fortunately there was nothing serious that came out of my doctor’s appointment. I only needed a two-week prescription.
* I spent the next few days taking a break from my daily routine to catch up on video games, relax at home, and enjoy loving a new furry friend.

But not everything was rainbows and sunshine the past few weeks.
* Unfortunately, in my endeavor to cat-proof the apartment, the rest of my herb seedlings didn’t make it. I think the seedlings are [much more sensitive to the tap water than I thought](https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/10-facts-you-may-not-know-about-new-york-citys-drinking-water/).
* I also was so focused on my schedule, I forgot to buy some mooncakes for [the Autumn Harvest Festival that occurred last Tuesday](https://www.chinahighlights.com/festivals/mid-autumn-festival-date.htm). Whoops. But I can try to find some mooncakes on sale now!


### What I’ve learned

Last week, I talked about the basis of electricity - charges and the forces that attract or repel them. Now it’s all about circuits!

I mentioned before that electricity and circuits were a weakness of mine for some time. In college, I only learned computers down to logical gates and motherboard component functions, but nothing about semiconductors or the physics behind how electronics worked. And you know, after spending a few weeks learning more about electricity, I remember why.

#### Voltage

You need energy to do work - and I mean this in terms of physics. A tennis ball cannot move without some force to nudge it, i.e. a push. A tennis ball cannot fall through the air without a way for it to be lifted into the air, i.e. a hand picking it up.

Voltage is a measurement of high electrical potential energy to low electrical potential energy. In a circuit, the battery provides energy (via a chemical reaction that generates electrical energy) to be able to do work. As the energy passes through the wire and components, a certain amount of energy is used up, and the voltage drops in each component.

#### Current

Current is the flow of positive charges in a wire per unit time. (In actuality, it’s usually the flow of electrons or negatively-charged particles that causes current. However, the convention stuck.) Without a voltage, these charges don’t have the energy to move as current!

#### Resistance

There’s resistance, which is where energy is lost in the circuit. Some of the energy is used to do useful work, like to generate the light in a lightbulb or generate a magnetic force. But lots of that energy also turns into heat, which could be intended or not. In reality, everything in a circuit has some resistance, including batteries and even the wire.

#### Circuits

A simple circuit consists of a voltage source and a resistor.


### What I’ve seen

This week, and probably in the next few blog posts, will be cat pics. Sorry, not sorry.
