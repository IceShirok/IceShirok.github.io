Hey folks! Due to a LOT of shenanigans that were happening over the course of late September to last October (work, vacations, settling in to a new home, etc), I've completely forgotten to write a War(un)lock post for October. (Whoops!)

While I had a ton of fun on my vacations and have plenty of other material to write more blog posts, it's about time that **I pause writing regular blog posts about my happenings and learnings**. It's been fun writing blog posts throughout my gap year and beyond, but having a regular job and managing other real life shenanigans don't make for much interesting content that I want to share at the moment. Instead, I want to, y'know, touch some grass and pet the cat more.

That doesn't mean that War(un)lock will be on an indefinite pause.

* I'll occasionally post stuff, but it will be at a "whenever I feel like it" cadence.
* Also, I'll probably cross-post through Twitter instead of LinkedIn, since I don't really go to LinkedIn for any other purposes other than the blog posts.
* Finally, I do have a few larger projects cooking up in the background. I would rather let it stew for a few months at a time with some occasional teasers, but nothing substantial enough for in-progress blog posts. (Hint hint, I'm ramping up the learnings in combination with some illustrations!)

Until then, **Monty and I wish you all a good and safe rest of 2022!**
