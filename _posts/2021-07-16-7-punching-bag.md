Hi folks, welcome to **War(un)lock blog #7**! The month of July has been a relative lull relative to May and June, so this blog post will be a little more rambly than usual. *tl;dr The past two weeks have been like a practice montage. Imagine me as a boxer in an old-school gym and going ham on a punching bag.*

### What I’ve been up to

#### Background
As I drafted this week’s blog post, I felt I had a lot less content to write about than I thought on the top of my head. I refreshed my memory with my bullet journal, where I generally write down my day-to-day. These records help me get a feel for what I’ve accomplished in a span of a couple of weeks, as it’s easy for me to get absorbed in the day-to-day.

I tend to set a few goals at the start of the month, so I know what kind of activities I should do throughout that month. What I forgot was that the goals I wrote down for July were more “practice” oriented. For example, two of my goals were to “improve my Chinese” and to “doodle at least 3 times per week”. As the weather generally flipped between a muggy heatwave and thunderstorms, I occupied myself with more indoor activities.

Then I looked back at what I wanted to accomplish in my gap year. My initial goal for the gap year was exploration, which meant me trying out a thousand different activities with little zero commitment.
* For example, I ended up dropping scuba diving certification for the time being. Getting certified in New York is (unsurprisingly) expensive to do, and I won’t be able to travel to a more tropical area this year.
* In contrast, cooking was something I didn’t expect to be as major. However, this does make sense since cooking is a money-saver!

This month has shifted from exploration and into practice. Perhaps I had my fill for exploration for the time being, as finding something new is sometimes discomforting to do, and I may not even enjoy it. (But hey, knowing what I don't like is just as important as what I do like.) I also wanted the gap year to be a time where I can really dig into a newly-discovered interest, or to refine other existing skills. Practice mode now required a lot of consistency and patience, as well as the ability to tolerate setbacks.

#### My practice montage
I gradually ditched weekly meal prep in favor of cooking every 1-3 days. The amount of time I spend cooking helps improve my cooking skills in general. I've memorized more recipes without needing to know the exact measurements of each ingredient, which is a huge timesaver in itself. I eventually have gotten comfortable enough with improvising simpler recipes, although results may vary. It also allows me to try out different recipes, especially from cooking tutorials on the web. Of course, I’m still occasionally lazy, and will go for a pantry snack or order takeout.

Volunteering in the hospital has become more of a routine, where I’m now generally familiar with the environment, my tasks, and the jargon. It also (unexpectedly) provided an opportunity to practice some Chinese if the need arises, which happens more often than I thought.

Finally, I’ve been catching up to my list of fantasy media.
* I’ve been reading The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. It has been a nice pre-bedtime reading, since I’ll be covering around 1,000 pages of content!
* I’ve also started playing Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire after having it linger in my video games collection for three years. These fantasy settings also make it easier to find inspiration for doodling and illustrating.

#### Now what?
Learning about new things without practicing makes the new information irrelevant, and ends up rotting in the back of my mind. With enough application and practice to the new information, it becomes knowledge. I hope to get to the point where I get to an intuitive expertise and call it “wisdom”!

Once the practice montage starts to get dull, I will get back into "exploration" mode and see what new things I'll discover next!

### What I’ve learned
If you don’t know already, I’ve been getting back into illustrating. I’m more partial to drawing people, since it’s interesting to draw various shapes, sizes, and poses. Since the gap year started, I revisited [some tutorials](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1tiwbzkOjQz9JtZAJ6ZUWYhaPb-vhapJ) so I can enjoy drawing immediately - so I don’t go agonizing over drawing eggs in various angles. Once I get the practice in, I can dive deeper into other realms and techniques, such as drawing eggs in various forms.

When drawing people, there are general rules of thumb on human proportions, such as where the eyes are in relation to the face. It can get overwhelming to have to also learn the anatomy behind the proportion, but can be a huge enhancer once the basics are nailed down. I tend to go slower on the tutorials, going at 1-2 tutorials per week and spend 30-60 minutes every day to draw.

I’ve been gravitating towards using pencil and pen. Pencil is used for sketching and doodling, while pen is used for outlining the crisp final product. There are also no colors to worry about, although that doesn’t absolve me from shading and highlights. I do have Procreate, but I found the tactile feedback of pen on paper to be much more satisfying than tablet. I do use it for minor touches and adjustments.

* The quality of pens and erasers are especially important to me. The pens should be able to handle well without bleeding ink, and should dry relatively quickly.
* The erasers should erase pencil marks cleanly, and not create more smudges in the process! I've definitely have not ruined my sketches due to bad erasers...
* I found that pencil brands are less important to me. I will tend to grab any pencil I can reach to start doodling.
* Strangely, I prefer to have lesser quality paper to draw on, as it creates less pressure for me to potentially waste high-quality paper to keep drawing.

While this blog is focused on my gap year progress, I'm still quite bashful when it comes to posting sketches! But if I keep practicing perhaps I will have drawings good enough to start posting on the regular!

### What I’ve seen
I actually was so occupied with practicing that I neglected to take photos along the way (oops). One of the few photos I took over the past 2 weeks was a lunch I’ve made - Japanese-style curry with rice, pickled cucumbers, and grapes.
