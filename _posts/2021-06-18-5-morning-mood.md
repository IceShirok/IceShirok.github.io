Hi folks, welcome back to **War(un)lock** blog #5.

### What I’ve been up to

#### On volunteering

#### On routines and setbacks

#### On doodling
Finally, I was in need of some storage for a collection of loose electronics. I had a spare cardboard box of a perfect size. I painted the sides of the box in an acrylic white, then drew some of my favorite media - Jet Set Radio Future, Fullmetal Alchemist, Critical Role, and Octopath Traveler.

All of these drawings were referenced from other images on the Internet, but I couldn’t find the links to some of them afterwards.*

I have been occasionally eating takeout to support restaurants and take a break from cooking. However, since COVID-19 rates have dramatically dropped in NYC, I’ve taken advantage of going out and hitting various restaurants around the city. Some are those that I’ve been meaning to visit since before the pandemic. Others were recommendations from friends from out-of-town. Others were places I’ve passed by out of happenstance, then spontaneously entered. After a weekend of what felt like binging, I would return to tested and true recipes such as [tomato and egg noodles](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/tomato-noodles-with-fried-egg/).
